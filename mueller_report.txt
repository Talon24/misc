INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME I

This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which
states that, “[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney
General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special
Counsel] reached.”

The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and
systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016. In
June, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that
Russian hackers had compromised its computer network. Releases of hacked materials—hacks
that public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government—began that same month.
Additional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in
October and November.

In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks’s first release of stolen documents, a foreign
government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy
advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign
government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that
it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July
31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign
were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.

That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government “directed
recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political
organizations,” and, “[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election
process.” After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia
for having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were
examining Russia’s interference in the election.

Within the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017
appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel
authorized him to investigate “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016
presidential election,” including any links or coordination between the Russian government and
individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.

As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel’s investigation established that
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a
Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence
service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers
working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also
identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although
the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit

electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not
establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
government in its election interference activities.

* %k kK

Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the
results of our investigation and the Special Counsel’s charging decisions, and we then provide an
overview of the two volumes of our report.

The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel’s Office found to be
supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out
the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other
instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with
confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events
occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there
was no evidence of those facts.

In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted
a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.” In so doing,
the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]” was used in communications with the Acting
Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation’s scope and that the term has
frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific
offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal
criminal law. For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability
was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the
factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign “coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears
in the appointment order—with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion,
“coordination” does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood
coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the
Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking
actions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests. We applied the term
coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the
Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

The report on our investigation consists of two volumes:

Volume I describes the factual results of the Special Counsel’s investigation of Russia’s
interference in the 2016 presidential election and its interactions with the Trump Campaign.
Section I describes the scope of the investigation. Sections II and III describe the principal ways
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Section IV describes links between the Russian

Volume II addresses the President’s actions towards the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s
interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters, and his actions towards the
Special Counsel’s investigation. Volume II separately states its framework and the considerations
that guided that investigation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME 1
RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN

The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference
operations identified by the investigation—a social media campaign designed to provoke and
amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg,
Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he

controlled. Prigozhin is widely reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin,

In mid-2014, the IRA sent employees to the United States on an intelligence-gathering
mission with instructions [REIGR RO TeTeI iTe JIE:14 =14

political system through what it termed “information warfare.” The campaign evolved from a
generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a
targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton,
The IRA’s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the
names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United
States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and
made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The
investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the
IRA. Section II of this report details the Office’s investigation of the Russian social media
campaign.

RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS

At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in
early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions
(hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian
intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian
Army (GRU) carried out these operations.

In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign
volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU
hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
(DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands
of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC
announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government’s role in hacking its network, the GRU
began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas “DCLeaks” and
“Guccifer 2.0.” The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.


==================== PAGE 14 ====================

 

The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign” or “Campaign”)

showed interest in WikiLeaks’s releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage
candidate Clinton. Beginning in June 2016, forecast to
senior Campaign officials that Wikil.eaks would release information damaging to candidate
Clinton. WikiLeaks’s first release came in July 2016. Around the same time, candidate Trump

announced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from a private server
of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcasticall

Harm to Ongoing Matter

   

WikiLeaks began releasing
Podesta’s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released
video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section III of this Report details the Office’s
investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign
supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.

RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN

The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of
contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.
The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring
or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and
worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from
information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that
members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its
election interference activities.

The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the
Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign
officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking
improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia
and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which
are summarized below in chronological order.

2015. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization
real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate Trump signed a Letter
of Intent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization
executive Michael Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian
government press secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through
at least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump.

Spring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact
with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to
Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told
Papadopoulos that the Russian government had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands

5


==================== PAGE 15 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WorcProduet // May-Contain-Material Proteeted-UnderFed—R—-Crim—P—6(e)

of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a
representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from
the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of
information damaging to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months
thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting
between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took place.

Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of
2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President. On
June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald
Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email
proposing the meeting had described as “official documents and information that would
incriminate Hillary.” The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as “part of Russia and its
government’s support for Mr. Trump.” The written communications setting up the meeting
showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist
candidate Trump’s electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer’s presentation did not provide such
information.

Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the DNC
announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC and obtained access to
opposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents.

In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity
to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had lived and worked
in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted
with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with
conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his
advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The Campaign then distanced itself
from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.

July 2016 was also the month Wikileaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the
DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing
information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S.
intelligence agencies had “high confidence” that the Russian government was behind the theft of
emails and documents from the DNC. And within a week of the release, a foreign government
informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the
Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign
government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the
Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.

Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York
City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties
to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for
Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a “backdoor” way for
Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate
Trump’s assent to succeed (were he to be elected President). They also discussed the status of the

AttorneyWotcProduet // May-CentainMaterial Proteeted-UnderFedR—Crim—P—6(e)

Trump Campaign and Manafort’s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states.
Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik,
and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.

Fall 2016. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in
graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy. Less
than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John Podesta’s emails that
had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. government institutions
were at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere
in the presidential election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement “that the Russian
Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions,
including from US political organizations.” Those “thefts” and the “disclosures” of the hacked
materials through online platforms such as WikilLeaks, the statement continued, “are intended to
interfere with the US election process.”

Post-2016 Election. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian government
officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
administration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The
Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to
arrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there.

Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, was among
the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December, a
business associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an
associate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in
January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations. During the same period,
another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served
on the Campaign or the Transition Team. Dmitriev and Kushner’s friend collaborated on a shott
written reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been
cleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and
Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having
interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian
Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the
sanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in
response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted, “Great move
on delay (by V. Putin).” The next day, on December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him
the request had been received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result
of Flynn’s request.

On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect Trump
on a joint assessment—drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and


==================== PAGE 17 ====================

National Security Agency—that concluded with high confidence that Russia had intervened in the
election through a variety of means to assist Trump’s candidacy and harm Clinton’s. A
declassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day.

Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees—the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)—announced that they would
conduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the
election. Then-FBI Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI’s
investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On March 20, 2017, in
open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey stated:

[ have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part
of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts
to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the
nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and
the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the
campaign and Russia’s efforts. . . . As with any counterintelligence investigation,
this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.

The investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until May 9,
2017, when President Trump fired Comey as FBI Director—an action which is analyzed in
Volume II of the report.

On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel
and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional
testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within
the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the
investigation.

President Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel’s appointment. He told advisors
that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions
unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in
efforts to curtail the Special Counsel’s investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it,
including through public and private contacts with potential witnesses. Those and related actions
are described and analyzed in Volume II of the report.

THE SPECIAL COUNSEL’S CHARGING DECISIONS

In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office
determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law
chargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual § 9-27.000 et seq.
(2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if
so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction;


==================== PAGE 18 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

   

and whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest that could not be adequately
served by prosecution elsewhere or through non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual § 9-
27220,

Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office’s charging decisions,
which contain three main components.

First, the Office determined that Russia’s two principal interference operations in the 2016

U.S. presidential election—the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations—
violated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media
campaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by
undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign
influence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet
Research Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers who
carried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts of
individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal laws,
the federal computer-intrusion statute, and they have been so charged. See Unifed Staies v.
ksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215 (D.D.C.). SEIUNCRCNFEIRFRIEUTY

    

 

Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to
the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was
not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to
charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian
principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks’s releases of hacked
materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence
was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with
representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.

Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump
Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated
individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian
election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal false-
statements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about
his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George
Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to
investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the
professor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of
thousands of emails. Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to
making false statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project. [EEWLRTRONTTINTY

        
 

 

And in February 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that

U.S. Department of Justice

   

Manafort lied to the Office and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications
with Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.

% % %

The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve
potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that interactions
between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate’s April
2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National
Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that
one Campaign official’s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing
assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The
investigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September
2016 at Sessions’s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential
campaign.

The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete
picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked
their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office’s
judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other
witnesses and information—such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be
members of the media—in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice
Manual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was
presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or
“taint”) team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes
provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges
described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as
well—numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United
States.

Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct
we investigated—including some associated with the Trump Campaign—deleted relevant
communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature
encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In
such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to
contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared
inconsistent with other known facts.

Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office
believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps,
the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional
light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.

I. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL’S INVESTIGATION

On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein—then serving as Acting
Attorney General for the Russia investigation following the recusal of former Attorney General
Jeff Sessions on March 2, 2016—appointed the Special Counsel “to investigate Russian
interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters.” Office of the Deputy Att’y
Gen., Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference
with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters, May 17, 2017) (“Appointment Order”).
Relying on “the authority vested” in the Acting Attorney General, “including 28 U.S.C. §§ 509,
510, and 515,” the Acting Attorney General ordered the appointment of a Special Counsel “in
order to discharge [the Acting Attorney General’s] responsibility to provide supervision and
management of the Department of Justice, and to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the
Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.” Appointment Order
(introduction). “The Special Counsel,” the Order stated, “is authorized to conduct the investigation
confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017,” including:

(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals
associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and

(ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and
(iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).

Appointment Order q (b). Section 600.4 affords the Special Counsel “the authority to investigate
and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the
Special Counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence,
and intimidation of witnesses.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). The authority to investigate “any matters
that arose . . . directly from the investigation,” Appointment Order 9 (b)(ii), covers similar crimes
that may have occurred during the course of the FBI’s confirmed investigation before the Special
Counsel’s appointment. “If the Special Counsel believes it is necessary and appropriate,” the
Order further provided, “the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from
the investigation of these matters.” Id. 9 (c). Finally, the Acting Attorney General made applicable
“Sections 600.4 through 600.10 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations.” Id. 9 (d).

The Acting Attorney General further clarified the scope of the Special Counsel’s
investigatory authority in two subsequent memoranda. A memorandum dated August 2, 2017,
explained that the Appointment Order had been “worded categorically in order to permit its public
release without confirming specific investigations involving specific individuals.” It then
confirmed that the Special Counsel had been authorized since his appointment to investigate
allegations that three Trump campaign officials—Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and George
Papadopoulos—“committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials
with respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.”
The memorandum also confirmed the Special Counsel’s authority to investigate certain other
matters, including two additional sets of allegations involving Manafort (crimes arising from
payments he received from the Ukrainian government and crimes arising from his receipt of loans

11


==================== PAGE 21 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WotleProduet // May-Contain-Material-Proteeted Under Fed—R—Crim—P—-6(e)

from a bank whose CEO was then seeking a position in the Trump Administration); allegations
that Papadopoulos committed a crime or crimes by acting as an unregistered agent of the Israeli
government; and four sets of allegations involving Michael Flynn, the former National Security
Advisor to President Trump.

On October 20, 2017, the Acting Attorney General confirmed in a memorandum the
Special Counsel’s investigative authority as to several individuals and entities. First, “as part of a
full and thorough investigation of the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016
presidential election,” the Special Counsel was authorized to investigate “the pertinent activities
of Michael Cohen, Richard Gates,_, Roger Stone, and

?  “Confirmation of the authorization to investigate such individuals,” the memorandum
stressed, “does not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a determination that any of them has
committed a crime.” Second, with respect to Michael Cohen, the memorandum recognized the
Special Counsel’s authority to investigate “leads relate[d] to Cohen’s establishment and use of
Essential Consultants LLC to, inter alia, receive funds from Russian-backed entities.” Third, the
memorandum memorialized the Special Counsel’s authority to investigate individuals and entities
who were possibly engaged in “jointly undertaken activity” with existing subjects of the
investigation, including Paul Manafort. Finally, the memorandum described an FBI investigation
opened before the Special Counsel’s appointment into “allegations that [then-Attorney General
Jeff Sessions] made false statements to the United States Senate[,]” and confirmed the Special
Counsel’s authority to investigate that matter.

The Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority “to
exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.” 28 C.F.R.
§ 600.6. Like a U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Special Counsel’s Office considered a range of
classified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office’s Russia
investigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions
of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution).
There was substantial evidence immediately available to the Special Counsel at the inception of
the investigation in May 2017 because the FBI had, by that time, already investigated Russian
election interference for nearly 10 months. The Special Counsel’s Office exercised its judgment
regarding what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a contact
between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and entities.

The Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian
government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain proceedings associated
with the Office’s work remain ongoing. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney
General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to other components
of the Department of Justice and FBI. Appendix D lists those transfers.

Two district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel’s authority to investigate
Russia election interference and links and/or coordination with the Trump Campaign. See United
States v. Manafort, 312 F. Supp. 3d 60, 79-83 (D.D.C. 2018); United States v. Manafort, 321 F.
Supp. 3d 640, 650-655 (E.D. Va. 2018). In the course of conducting that investigation, the Office
periodically identified evidence of potential criminal activity that was outside the scope of the
Special Counsel’s authority established by the Acting Attorney General. After consultation with

12

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WotlProduet // Mey-Centain-Material Proteeted-Under-Fed—R-Crim—P—6(e)

the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office referred that evidence to appropriate law
enforcement authorities, principally other components of the Department of Justice and to the FBI.
Appendix D summarizes those referrals.

* ok %k

To carry out the investigation and prosecution of the matters assigned to him, the Special
Counsel assembled a team that at its high point included 19 attorneys—five of whom joined the
Office from private practice and 14 on detail or assigned from other Department of Justice
components. These attorneys were assisted by a filter team of Department lawyers and FBI
personnel who screened materials obtained via court process for privileged information before
turning those materials over to investigators; a support staff of three paralegals on detail from the
Department’s Antitrust Division; and an administrative staff of nine responsible for budget,
finance, purchasing, human resources, records, facilities, security, information technology, and
administrative support. The Special Counsel attorneys and support staff were co-located with and
worked alongside approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, a
paralegal, and professional staff assigned by the FBI to assist the Special Counsel’s investigation.
Those “assigned” FBI employees remained under FBI supervision at all times; the matters on
which they assisted were supervised by the Special Counsel.!

During its investigation the Office issued more than 2,800 subpoenas under the auspices of
a grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia; executed nearly 500 search-and-seizure warrants;
obtained more than 230 orders for communications records under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d); obtained
almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers; made 13 requests to foreign governments
pursuant to Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties; and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses,
including almost 80 before a grand jury.

& & 3k

From its inception, the Office recognized that its investigation could identify foreign
intelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI’s broader national security
mission. FBI personnel who assisted the Office established procedures to identify and convey
such information to the FBI. The FBI’s Counterintelligence Division met with the Office regularly
for that purpose for most of the Office’s tenure. For more than the past year, the FBI also
embedded personnel at the Office who did not work on the Special Counsel’s investigation, but
whose purpose was to review the results of the investigation and to send—in writing—summaries
of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information to FBIHQ and FBI Field Offices.
Those communications and other correspondence between the Office and the FBI contain
information derived from the investigation, not all of which is contained in this Volume. This
Volume is a summary. It contains, in the Office’s judgment, that information necessary to account
for the Special Counsel’s prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation’s
main factual results.

 

UFBI personnel assigned to the Special Counsel’s Office wete required to adhere to all applicable
federal law and all Department and FBI regulations, guidelines, and policies. An FBI attorney worked on
FBI-related matters for the Office, such as FBI compliance with all FBI policies and procedures, including
the FBI’s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG). That FBI attorney worked under FBI
legal supervision, not the Special Counsel’s supetvision.

II. RUSSIAN “ACTIVE MEASURES” SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN

The first form of Russian election influence came principally from the Internet Research
Agency, LLC (IRA), a Russian organization funded by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and
companies he controlled, including Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord
Catering (collectively “Concord”).> The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large
U.S. audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system.’> These operations
constituted “active measures” (akTHEHBIE MepOIIPUATHS), a term that typically refers to operations
conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs.*

The IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as 2014.
Using fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages
designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S.
political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over time, these
social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences. IRA employees travelled to
the United States in mid-2014 on an intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and
photographs for use in their social media posts.

IRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the 2016
U.S. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump
Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various expenditures to carry
out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S.
persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their
Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the
staging of political rallies.®> The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons
knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation.

By the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S.
persons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and

 

% The Office is aware of reports that other Russian entities engaged in similar active measures
operations targeting the United States. Some evidence collected by the Office corroborates those reports,
and the Office has shared that evidence with other offices in the Department of Justice and FBI.

2. U.S. Operations Through IRA-Controlled Social Media Accounts

Dozens of IRA employees were responsible for operating accounts and personas on
different U.S. social media platforms. The IRA referred to employees assigned to operate the
social media accounts as “specialists.”*? Starting as early as 2014, the IRA’s U.S. operations
included social media specialists focusing on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.** The IRA later
added specialists who operated on Tumblr and Instagram accounts.*

Initially, the IRA created social media accounts that pretended to be the personal accounts
of U.S. persons.*® By early 2015, the IRA began to create larger social media groups or public
social media pages that claimed (falsely) to be affiliated with U.S. political and grassroots
organizations. In certain cases, the IRA created accounts that mimicked real U.S. organizations.
For example, one IRA-controlled Twitter account, @TEN_GOP, purported to be connected to the
Tennessee Republican Party.** More commonly, the IRA created accounts in the names of
fictitious U.S. organizations and grassroots groups and used these accounts to pose as anti-
immigration groups, Tea Party activists, Black Lives Matter protestors, and other U.S. social and
political activists.

The IRA closely monitored the activity of its social media accounts.

groups (with names such as “Being Patriotic,” “Stop All Immigrants,” “Secured Borders,” and
“Tea Party News™), purported Black social justice groups (“Black Matters,” “Blacktivist,” and
“Don’t Shoot Us™), LGBTQ groups (“LGBT United”), and religious groups (“United Muslims of
America™).

Throughout 2016, IRA accounts published an increasing number of materials supporting
the Trump Campaign and opposing the Clinton Campaign. For example, on May 31, 2016, the
operational account “Matt Skiber” began to privately message dozens of pro-Trump Facebook
groups asking them to help plan a “pro-Trump rally near Trump Tower.”>®

To reach larger U.S. audiences, the IRA purchased advertisements from Facebook that
promoted the IRA groups on the newsfeeds of U.S. audience members. According to Facebook,
the IRA purchased over 3,500 advertisements, and the expenditures totaled approximately
$100,000.%

During the U.S. presidential campaign, many IRA-purchased advertisements explicitly
supported or opposed a presidential candidate or promoted U.S. rallies organized by the IRA
(discussed below). As early as March 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements that overtly
opposed the Clinton Campaign. For example, on March 18, 2016, the IRA purchased an
advertisement depicting candidate Clinton and a caption that read in part, “If one day God lets
this liar enter the White House as a president — that day would be a real national tragedy.””’
Similarly, on April 6, 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements for its account “Black Matters”
calling for a “flashmob” of U.S. persons to “take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or
#nohillary2016.”*®  IRA-purchased advertisements featuring Clinton were, with very few
exceptions, negative.>’

IRA-purchased advertisements referencing candidate Trump largely supported his
campaign. The first known IRA advertisement explicitly endorsing the Trump Campaign was
purchased on April 19, 2016. The IRA bought an advertisement for its Instagram account “Tea
Party News” asking U.S. persons to help them “make a patriotic team of young Trump supporters”
by uploading photos with the hashtag “#KIDS4TRUMP.”®® In subsequent months, the TRA
purchased dozens of advertisements supporting the Trump Campaign, predominantly through the
Facebook groups “Being Patriotic,” “Stop All Invaders,” and “Secured Borders.”

Collectively, the IRA’s social media accounts reached tens of millions of U.S. persons.
Individual IRA social media accounts attracted hundreds of thousands of followers. For example,
at the time they were deactivated by Facebook in mid-2017, the IRA’s “United Muslims of
America” Facebook group had over 300,000 followers, the “Don’t Shoot Us” Facebook group had
over 250,000 followers, the “Being Patriotic” Facebook group had over 200,000 followers, and
the “Secured Borders” Facebook group had over 130,000 followers.! According to Facebook, in
total the IRA-controlled accounts made over 80,000 posts before their deactivation in August 2017,
and these posts reached at least 29 million U.S persons and “may have reached an estimated 126
million people.”®

4. U.S. Operations Through Twitter

A number of IRA employees assigned to the Translator Department served as Twitter
specialists. EHURCRe TN Eli1s

The IRA operated individualized Twitter accounts similar to the operation of its Facebook
accounts, by continuously posting original content to the accounts while also communicating with
U.S. Twitter users directly (through public tweeting or Twitter’s private messaging).

The IRA used many of these accounts to attempt to influence U.S. audiences on the
election. Individualized accounts used to influence the U.S. presidential election included
@TEN_GOP (described above); @jenn_abrams (claiming to be a Virginian Trump supporter with
70,000 followers); @Pamela_Moorel3 (claiming to be a Texan Trump supporter with 70,000
followers); and @America lst_(an anti-immigration persona with 24,000 followers).*” In May
2016, the IRA created the Twitter account @march_for_trump, which promoted IRA-organized
rallies in support of the Trump Campaign (described below).58

5. U.S. Operations Involving Political Rallies

The IRA organized and promoted political rallies inside the United States while posing as
U.S. grassroots activists. First, the IRA used one of its preexisting social media personas
(Facebook groups and Twitter accounts, for example) to announce and promote the event. The
IRA then sent a large number of direct messages to followers of its social media account asking
them to attend the event. From those who responded with interest in attending, the IRA then sought
a U.S. person to serve as the event’s coordinator. In most cases, the IRA account operator would
tell the U.S. person that they personally could not attend the event due to some preexisting conflict
or because they were somewhere else in the United States.®> The IRA then further promoted the
event by contacting U.S. media about the event and directing them to speak with the coordinator.*
After the ivent, the IRA posted videos and photographs of the event to the IRA’s social media
accounts.®

The Office identified dozens of U.S. rallies organized by the IRA. The earliest evidence of
a rally was a “confederate rally” in November 2015.% The IRA continued to organize rallies even
after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The attendance at rallies varied. Some rallies appear to

have drawn few (if any) participants, while others drew hundreds. The reach and success of these

From June 2016 until the end of the presidential campaign,
almost all of the U.S. rallies organized by the IRA focused on the
U.S. election, often promoting the Trump Campaign and opposing
the Clinton Campaign. Pro-Trump rallies included three in New

3 York; a series of pro-Trump rallies in Florida in August 2016; and a

7. Interactions and Contacts with the Trump Campaign

The investigation identified two different forms of connections between the IRA and
members of the Trump Campaign. (The investigation identified no similar connections between
the IRA and the Clinton Campaign.) First, on multiple occasions, members and surrogates of the
Trump Campaign promoted—typically by linking, retweeting, or similar methods of reposting—
pro-Trump or anti-Clinton content published by the IRA through IRA-controlled social media
accounts, Additionally, in a few instances, IRA employees represented themselves as U.S. persons
to communicate with members of the Trump Campaign in an effort to seck assistance and
coordination on IRA-organized political rallies inside the United States.

a. Trump Campaign Promotion of IRA Political Materials
Among the U.S. “leaders of public opinion” targeted by the IRA were various members
and surrogates of the Trump Campaign. In total, Trump Campaign affiliates promoted dozens of

tweets, posts, and other political content created by the IRA.

- Posts from the IRA-controlled Twitter account @TEN_GOP were cited or retweeted by
multiple Trump Campaign officials and surrogates, including Donald J. Trump Jr.,*® Eric

b. Contact with Trump Campaign Officials in Connection to Rallies

Starting in June 2016, the IRA contacted different U.S. persons affiliated with the Trump
Campaign in an effort to coordinate pro-Trump IRA-organized rallies inside the United States. In
all cases, the IRA contacted the Campaign while claiming to be U.S. political activists working on
behalf of a conservative grassroots organization. The IRA’s contacts included requests for signs
and other materials to use at rallies,'%” as well as requests to promote the rallies and help coordinate
logistics.'®® While certain campaign volunteers agreed to provide the requested support (for
example, agreeing to set aside a number of signs), the investigation has not identified evidence
that any Trump Campaign official understood the requests were coming from foreign nationals.

s %k

In sum, the investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election
through the “active measures” social media campaign carried out by the IRA, an organization
funded by Prigozhin and companies that he controlled. As explained further in Volume I, Section
V.A, infia, the Office concluded (and a grand jury has alleged) that Prigozhin, his companies, and
IRA employees violated U.S. law through these operations, principally by undermining through
deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S.
elections.

III. RUSSIAN HACKING AND DUMPING OPERATIONS

Beginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation’s Main Intelligence Directorate
of the General Staff (GRU) hacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, employees,
and volunteers supporting the Clinton Campaign, including the email account of campaign
chairman John Podesta. Starting in April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National
Committee (DNC). The GRU targeted hundreds of email accounts used by Clinton Campaign
employees, advisors, and volunteers. In total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents
from the compromised email accounts and networks.'” The GRU later released stolen Clinton
Campaign and DNC documents through online personas, “DCLeaks” and “Guccifer 2.0,” and later
through the organization WikiLeaks. The release of the documents was designed and timed to
interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.

Military Unit 74455 is a related GRU unit with multiple departments that engaged in cyber
operations. Unit 74455 assisted in the release of documents stolen by Unit 26165, the promotion
of those releases, and the publication of anti-Clinton content on social media accounts operated by
the GRU. Officers from Unit 74455 separately hacked computers belonging to state boards of
elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology
related to the administration of U.S. elections.'™

2. Intrusions into the DCCC and DNC Networks
a. Initial Access

By no later than April 12, 2016, the GRU had gained access to the DCCC computer
network using the credentials stolen from a DCCC employee who had been successfully
spearphished the week before. Over the ensuing weeks, the GRU traversed the network,
identifying different computers connected to the DCCC network. By stealing network access
credentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the
system), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network.'"

Approximately six days after first hacking into the DCCC network, on April 18, 2016,
GRU officers gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection'?
between the DCCC and DNC networks.'?' Between April 18, 2016 and June 8, 2016, Unit 26165
compromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mail server and
shared file server.'??

b. Implantation of Malware on DCCC and DNC Networks

Unit 26165 implanted on the DCCC and DNC networks two types of customized
malware,'?* known as “X-Agent” and “X-Tunnel”; Mimikatz, a credential-harvesting tool; and
rar.exe, a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration. X-Agent
was a multi-function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes, take screenshots, and
gather other data about the infected computers (e.g., file directories, operating systems).!?* X-
Tunnel was a hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC
computers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networks that was capable
of large-scale data transfers.'?® GRU officers then used X-Tunnel to exfiltrate stolen data from the
victim computers.

 

 

120 A VPN extends a private network, allowing users to send and receive data across public
networks (such as the internet) as if the connecting computer was directly connected to the private network.
The VPN in this case had been created to give a small number of DCCC employees access to certain
databases housed on the DNC network. Therefore, while the DCCC employees were outside the DNC’s
private network, they could access parts of the DNC network from their DCCC computers.

To operate X-Agent and X-Tunnel on the DCCC and DNC networks, Unit 26165 officers
set up a group of computers outside those networks to communicate with the implanted
malware.'?® The first set of GRU-controlled computers, known by the GRU as “middle servers,”
sent and received messages to and from malware on the DNC/DCCC networks. The middle

servers, in turn, relayed messages to a second set of GRU-controlled computers, labeled internally
by the GRU as an “AMS Panel.” The AMS Panel [[INGIEEUNER I IS served as a
nerve center through which GRU officers monitored and directed the malware’s operations on the

DNC/DCCC networks.'?”

The Arizona-based AMS Panel also stored thousands of files containing keylogging
sessions captured through X-Agent. These sessions were captured as GRU officers monitored
DCCC and DNC employees” work on infected computers regularly between April 2016 and June
2016. Data captured in these keylogging sessions included passwords, internal communications
between employees, banking information, and sensitive personal information.

¢. Theft of Documents from DNC and DCCC Networks

Officers from Unit 26165 stole thousands of documents from the DCCC and DNC
networks, including significant amounts of data pertaining to the 2016 U.S. federal elections.
Stolen documents included internal strategy documents, fundraising data, opposition research, and
emails from the work inboxes of DNC employees.'*

The GRU began stealing DCCC data shortly after it gained access to the network. On April
14, 2016 (approximately three days after the initial intrusion) GRU officers downloaded rar.exe
onto the DCCC’s document server. The following day, the GRU searched one compromised
DCCC computer for files containing search terms that included “Hillary,” “DNC,” “Cruz,” and
“Trump.”"®! On April 25,2016, the GRU collected and compressed PDF and Microsoft documents
from folders on the DCCC’s shared file server that pertained to the 2016 election.'*> The GRU
appears to have compressed and exfiltrated over 70 gigabytes of data from this file server.!*?

The GRU also stole documents from the DNC network shortly after gaining access. On
April 22, 2016, the GRU copied files from the DNC network to GRU-controlled computers. Stolen
documents included the DNC’s opposition research into candidate Trump.'* Between
approximately May 25, 2016 and June 1, 2016, GRU officers accessed the DNC’s mail server
from a GRU-controlled computer leased inside the United States.!* During these connections,

Unit 26165 officers appear to have stolen thousands of emails and attachments, which were later
released by Wikil.eaks in July 2016.'%

B. Dissemination of the Hacked Materials

The GRU’s operations extended beyond stealing materials, and included releasing
documents stolen from the Clinton Campaign and its supporters. The GRU carried out the
anonymous release through two fictitious online personas that it created—DCLeaks and Guccifer
2.0—and later through the organization WikiLeaks.

1. DCLeaks

The GRU began planning the releases at least as early as April 19, 2016, when Unit 26165
registered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant."*” Unit 26165
paid for the registration using a pool of bitcoin that it had mined.'** The dcleaks.com landing page
pointed to different tranches of stolen documents, arranged by victim or subject matter. Other
dcleaks.com pages contained indexes of the stolen emails that were being released (bearing the
sender, recipient, and date of the email). To control access and the timing of releases, pages were
sometimes password-protected for a period of time and later made unrestricted to the public.

Starting in June 2016, the GRU posted stolen documents onto the website dcleaks.com,
including documents stolen from a number of individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign.
These documents appeared to have originated from personal email accounts (in particular, Google
and Microsoft accounts), rather than the DNC and DCCC computer networks. DCLeaks victims
included an advisor to the Clinton Campaign, a former DNC employee and Clinton Campaign
employee, and four other campaign volunteers.'”” The GRU released through dcleaks.com
thousands of documents, including personal identifying and financial information, internal
correspondence related to the Clinton Campaign and prior political jobs, and fundraising files and
information.!*’

 

136 Netyksho Indictment 9 29. The last-in-time DNC email released by WikiLeaks was dated May

DCLeaks released documents relating to , emails belonging

“The United States Republican Party”). “The United States Republican Party” portfolio contained
approximately 300 emails from a variety of GOP members, PACs, campaigns, state patties, and businesses
dated between May and October 2015. According to open-source reporting, these victims shared the same

GRU officers operated a Facebook page under the DCLeaks moniker, which they primarily
used to promote releases of materials.!*! The Facebook page was administered through a small
number of preexisting GRU-controlled Facebook accounts.!*?

GRU officers also used the DCLeaks Facebook account, the Twitter account @dcleaks_,
and the email account dcleaksproject@gmail.com to communicate privately with reporters and
“other U.S. persons. GRU officers using the DCLeaks persona gave certain reporters early access
to archives of leaked files by sending them links and passwords to pages on the dcleaks.com
website that had not yet become public. For example, on July 14, 2016, GRU officers operating
under the DCLeaks persona sent a link and password for a non-public DCLeaks webpage to a U.S.
reporter via the Facebook account.!*® Similarly, on September 14, 2016, GRU officers sent
reporters Twitter direct messages from @dcleaks_, with a password to another non-public part of
the dcleaks.com website.!"*

The DCLeaks.com website remained operational and public until March 2017.
2. Guecifer 2.0

On June 14, 2016, the DNC and its cyber-response team announced the breach of the DNC
network and suspected theft of DNC documents. In the statements, the cyber-response team
alleged that Russian state-sponsored actors (which they referred to as “Fancy Bear”) were
responsible for the breach.'*> Apparently in response to that announcement, on June 15, 2016,
GRU officers using the persona Guccifer 2.0 created a WordPress blog. In the hours leading up
to the launch of that WordPress blog, GRU officers logged into a Moscow-based server used and
managed by Unit 74455 and searched for a number of specific words and phrases in English,
including “some hundred sheets,” “illuminati,” and “worldwide known.” Approximately two
hours after the last of those searches, Guccifer 2.0 published its first post, attributing the DNC
server hack to a lone Romanian hacker and using several of the unique English words and phrases
that the GRU officers had searched for that day.'*®

That same day, June 15, 2016, the GRU also used the Guccifer 2.0 WordPress blog to begin
releasing to the public documents stolen from the DNC and DCCC computer networks.  The
Guccifer 2.0 persona ultimately released thousands of documents stolen from the DNC and DCCC
in a series of blog posts between June 15, 2016 and October 18, 2016.17 Released documents
included opposition research performed by the DNC (including a memorandum analyzing
potential criticisms of candidate Trump), internal policy documents (such as recommendations on
how to address politically sensitive issues), analyses of specific congressional races, and
fundraising documents. Releases were organized around thematic issues, such as specific states
(e.g., Florida and Pennsylvania) that were perceived as competitive in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election.

Beginning in late June 2016, the GRU also used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release
documents directly to reporters and other interested individuals. Specifically, on June 27, 2016,
Guccifer 2.0 sent an email to the news outlet The Smoking Gun offering to provide “exclusive
access to some leaked emails linked [to] Hillary Clinton’s staff.”!*® The GRU later sent the
reporter a password and link to a locked portion of the dcleaks.com website that contained an
archive of emails stolen by Unit 26165 from a Clinton Campaign volunteer in March 2016.'*° That
the Guccifer 2.0 persona provided reporters access to a restricted portion of the DCLeaks website
tends to indicate that both personas were operated by the same or a closely-related group of
people.!*°

The GRU continued its release efforts through Guccifer 2.0 into August 2016. For
example, on August 15, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a candidate for the U.S. Congress
documents related to the candidate’s opponent.'>' On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona
transferred approximately 2.5 gigabytes of Florida-related data stolen from the DCCC to a U.S.
blogger covering Florida politics.'> On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a U.S.
reporter documents stolen from the DCCC pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement.'*?

 

147 Releases of documents on the Guecifer 2.0 blog occurred on June 15, 2016; June 20, 2016; June
21, 2016; July 6, 2016; July 14, 2016; August 12, 2016; August 15, 2016; August 21, 2016; August 31,

130 Before sending the reporter the link and password to the closed DCLeaks website, and in an
apparent effort to deflect attention from the fact that DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 were operated by the same
organization, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent the reporter an email stating that DCLeaks was a “Wikileaks
sub project” and that Guccifer 2.0 had asked DCLeaks to release the leaked emails with “closed access” to
give reporters a preview of them.

responded, “pretty standard.”’*®> The investigation did not identify evidence of other
communications betweenw and Guccifer 2.0.

3. Use of WikiLeaks

In order to expand its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the GRU units
transferred many of the documents they stole from the DNC and the chairman of the Clinton
Campaign to WikilLeaks. GRU officers used both the DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 personas to
communicate with WikiLeaks through Twitter private messaging and through encrypted channels,
including possibly through Wikil.eaks’s private communication system.

a. WikiLeaks’s Expressed Opposition Toward the Clinton Campaign

WikiLeaks, and particularly its founder Julian Assange, privately expressed opposition to
candidate Clinton well before the first release of stolen documents. In November 2015, Assange
wrote to other members and associates of WikilLeaks that “[w]e believe it would be much better
for GOP to win . . . Dems+Media+liberals woudl [sic] then form a block to reign in their worst
qualities. ...  With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities.,
dems+media-+neoliberals will be mute. . . . She’s a bright, well connected, sadisitic sociopath.”!>¢

In March 2016, WikiLeaks released a searchable archive of approximately 30,000 Clinton
emails that had been obtained through FOIA litigation.'”” While designing the archive, one
WikiLeaks member explained the reason for building the archive to another associate:

the same thing, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposmon Hence hillary has greater freedom
to start wars than the GOP and has the will to do s0.” Id.

annoy Hillary, but secondly because we want to be seen to be a resource/player in the US
election, because eit [sic] may en[]courage people to send us even more important leaks. '*®

b. WikiLeaks’s First Contact with Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks

Shortly after the GRU’s first release of stolen documents through dcleaks.com in June
2016, GRU officers also used the DCLeaks persona to contact WikilLeaks about possible
coordination in the future release of stolen emails. On June 14, 2016, @dcleaks sent a direct
message to @WikiLeaks, noting, “You announced your organization was preparing to publish
more Hillary’s emails. We are ready to support you. We have some sensitive information too, in

particular, her financial documents. Let’s do it toether What do ou thmk about publishing our
»159 [} aa | al

info at the same moment? Thank iou

Around the same time, Wikil.eaks initiated communications with the GRU persona
Guccifer 2.0 shortly after it was used to release documents stolen from the DNC. On June 22,
2016, seven days after Guccifer 2.0°s first releases of stolen DNC documents, WikiLeaks used
Twitter’s direct message function to contact the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter account and suggest that
Guccifer 2.0 “[s]end any new material [stolen from the DNC] here for us to review and it will have
a much higher impact than what you are doing,”'®

 
 

On July 6, 2016, WikilLeaks again contacted Guccifer 2.0 through Twittet’s private
messaging function, writing, “if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic]
days prefable [sic] because the DNC is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind
her after.” The Guccifer 2.0 persona responded, “ok . . . i see.” WikiLeaks also explained, “we
think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary . . . so conflict between bernie and
hillary is interesting.”!!

¢. The GRU’s Transfer of Stolen Materials to WikiLeaks
Both the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications, which has limited the

Office’s ability to collect all of the communications between them. Thus, although it is clear that
the stolen DNC and Podesta documents were transferred from the GRU to WikiLeaks,

The Office was able to identify when the GRU (operating through its personas Guccifer 2.0
and DCLeaks) transferred some of the stolen documents to Wikil.eaks through online archives set
up by the GRU. Assange had access to the internet from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,

     

On July 14, 2016, GRU officers used a Guccifer 2.0 email account to send WikiLeaks an
email bearing the subject “big archive” and the message “a new attempt.”'®® The email contained
an encrypted attachment with the name “wk dnc link1.txt.gpg.”'** Using the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter
account, GRU officers sent WikiLeaks an encrypted file and instructions on how to open it.'®> On
July 18, 2016, Wikil.eaks confirmed in a direct message to the Guccifer 2.0 account that it had
“the 1Gb or so archive” and would make a release of the stolen documents “this week.”'*® On
July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released over 20,000 emails and other documents stolen from the DNC
computer networks.'®” The Democratic National Convention began three days later.

Similar communications occurred between Wikil.eaks and the GRU-operated persona
DCLeaks. On September 15, 2016, @dcleaks wrote to @WikiLeaks, “hi there! I'm from DC
Leaks. How could we discuss some submission-related issues? Am trying to reach out to you via

arrange for a way to speak through encrypted emails.!”

An analysis of the metadata collected from the WikiLeaks site revealed that the stolen
Podesta emails show a creation date of September 19, 2016.1"" Based on information about
Assange’s computer and its possible operating system, this date may be when the GRU staged the
stolen Podesta emails for transfer to WikiLeaks (as the GRU had previously done in July 2016 for
the DNC emails).'” The WikiLeaks site also released PDFs and other documents taken from
Podesta that were attachments to emails in his account; these documents had a creation date of
October 2, 2016, which appears to be the date the attachments were separately staged by
WikiLeaks on its site.!”

Beginning on September 20, 2016, WikilLeaks and DCLeaks resumed communications in
a brief exchange. On September 22, 2016, a DCLeaks email account deleaksproject@gmail.com
sent an email to a WikiLeaks account with the subject “Submission” and the message “Hi from
DCLeaks.” The email contained a PGP-encrypted message with the filename
“wiki_mail.txt.gpg.”!7 The email, however, bears a
number of similarities to the July 14, 2016 email in which GRU officers used the Guccifer 2.0
persona to give WikiLeaks access to the archive of DNC files. On September 22, 2016 (the same
day of DCLeaks’ email to WikiLeaks), the Twitter account @dcleaks sent a single message to
Wikileaks with the string of characters

   
   
   

The Office cannot rule out that stolen documents were transferred to WikiLeaks through
intermediaries who visited during the summer of 2016. For example, public reporting identified
Andrew Miiller-Maguhn as a Wikil.eaks associate who may have assisted with the transfer of these
stolen documents to Wikileaks.'”

At the time, certain Apple operating systems used a setting that left a

explain why the creation date on Wikileals’s version of the files was still September 19, 2016. See SM-

account. In total, WikiLeaks released 33 tranches of stolen emails between October 7, 2016 and

November 7, 2016. The releases included private speeches given by Clinton;
communications between Podesta and other high-ranking members of the Clinton Campaign;
and correspondence related to the Clinton Foundation.'” In total, WikiLeaks released over 50,000
documents stolen from Podesta’s personal email account. The last-in-time email released from
Podesta’s account was dated March 21, 2016, two days after Podesta received a spearphishing
email sent by the GRU.

d. WikiLeaks Statements Dissembling About the Source of Stolen Materials

As reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged,
WikiLeaks and Assange made several public statements apparently designed to obscure the source
of the materials that WikiLeaks was releasing. The file-transfer evidence described above and
other information uncovered during the investigation discredit WikiLeaks’s claims about the
source of material that it posted.

Beginning in the summer of 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements
about Seth Rich, a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016. The statements about
Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails. On August 9, 2016,
the @WikiLeaks Twitter account posted: “ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a
US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.”!%
Likewise, on August 25, 2016, Assange was asked in an interview, “Why are you so interested in
Seth Rich’s killer?” and responded, “We’re very interested in anything that might be a threat to
alleged Wikileaks sources.” The interviewer responded to Assange’s statement by commenting,
“I know you don’t want to reveal your source, but it certainly sounds like you’re suggesting a man
who leaked information to WikiLeaks was then murdered.” Assange replied, “If there’s someone
who’s potentially connected to our publication, and that person has been murdered in suspicious

circumstances, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the two are connected. But it is a very serious
matter...that type of allegation is very serious, as it’s taken very seriously by us.”'*!

After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was
behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by
WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking. According to media reports, Assange told a U.S.
congressman that the DNC hack was an “inside job,” and purported to have “physical proof” that
Russians did not give materials to Assange.!'®?

C. Additional GRU Cyber Operations

While releasing the stolen emails and documents through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and
WikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hack victims linked to the Democratic campaign
and, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in several states.

1. Summer and Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims

On July 27, 2016, Unit 26165 targeted email accounts connected to candidate Clinton’s
personal office _ Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that
included the following: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails
that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”'® The “30,000
emails” were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored
on a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State.

Within approximately five hours of Trump’s statement, GRU officers targeted for the first
time Clinton’s personal office. After candidate Trump’s remarks, Unit 26165 created and sent
malicious links targeting 15 email accounts at the domain _ including an email
account belonging to Clinton aide _ The investigation did not find evidence of earlier
GRU attempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain. It is unclear how the GRU was
able to identify these email accounts, which were not public.'®*

Unit 26165 officers also hacked into a DNC account hosted on a cloud-computing service
On September 20, 2016, the GRU began to generate
function designed to allow users to produce backups of
as “snapshots”). The GRU then stole those snapshots by moving

  
    
  
 

copies of the DNC data usin

them to - account that they controlled; from there, the copies were moved to GRU-
controlled computers. The GRU stole approximately 300 gigabytes of data from the DNC cloud-
based account.!83

2. Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections

In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also
targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections. Victims included
U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and
county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities.!® The GRU also
targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related
software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.'®” The
GRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the
investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office
did not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other
relevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity.

By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer
networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental
entities. GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a
technique known as “SQL injection,” by which malicious code was sent to the state or local
website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents).'®® In one instance
in approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State
Board of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE’s website. The GRU then gained
access to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters,'® and
extracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified.'*’

GRU officers _ scanned state and local websites for

vulnerabilities. For example, over a two-day period in July 2016, GRU officers -
for vulnerabilities on websites of more than

two dozen states.

Investigative Technique

 

Similar L8 for vulnerabilities continued through the election.

Unit 74455 also sent spearphishing emails to public officials involved in election
administration and personnel at companies involved in voting technology. In August 2016, GRU
officers targeted employees ofﬁ, a voting technology company that developed software
used by numerous U.S. counties to manage voter rolls, and installed malware on the company
network. Similarly, in November 2016, the GRU sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email
accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election.'®!
The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious software
(commonly referred to as a Trojan) that permitted the GRU to access the infected computer.'*?
The FBI was separately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believes that this
operation enabled the GRU to gain access to the network of at least one Florida county
government. The Office did not independently verify that belief and, as explained above, did not
undertake the investigative steps that would have been necessary to do so.

2. Other Potential Campaign Interest in Russian Hacked Materials

Throughout 2016, the Trump Campaign expressed interest in Hillary Clinton’s private
email server and whether approximately 30,000 emails from that server had in fact been
permanently destroyed, as reported by the media. Several individuals associated with the
Campaign were contacted in 2016 about various efforts to obtain the missing Clinton emails and
other stolen material in support of the Trump Campaign. Some of these contacts were met with
skepticism, and nothing came of them; others were pursued to some degree. The investigation did
not find evidence that the Trump Campaign recovered any such Clinton emails, or that these
contacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign.

a. Henry Oknyansky (a/k/a Henry Greenberg)

In the spring of 2016, Trump Campaign advisor Michael Caputo learned through a Florida-
based Russian business partner that another Florida-based Russian, Henry Oknyansky (who also
went by the name Henry Greenberg), claimed to have information pertaining to Hillary Clinton.
Caputo notified Roger Stone and brokered communication between Stone and Oknyansky.
Oknyansky and Stone set up a May 2016 in-person meeting.?%

Oknyansky was accompanied to the meeting by Alexei Rasin, a Ukrainian associate
involved in Florida real estate. At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information
on Clinton that Rasin claimed to have obtained while working for Clinton. Rasin claimed to
possess financial statements demonstrating Clinton’s involvement in money laundering with
Rasin’s companies. According to Oknyansky, Stone asked if the amounts in question totaled
millions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands. Stone refused the offer,
stating that Trump would not pay for opposition research, 26!

Oknyansky claimed to the Office that Rasin’s motivation was financial. According to
Oknyansky, Rasin had tried unsuccessfully to shop the Clinton information around to other
interested parties, and Oknyansky would receive a cut if the information was sold.?*? Rasin is
noted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a number of Florida
companies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton. The Office found no other evidence
that Rasin worked for Clinton or any Clinton-related entities.

In their statements to investigators, Oknyansky and Caputo had contradictory recollections
about the meeting. Oknyansky claimed that Caputo accompanied Stone to the meeting and
provided an introduction, whereas Caputo did not tell us that he had attended and claimed that he
was never told what information Oknyansky offered. Caputo also stated that he was unaware

Oknyansky sought to be paid for the information until Stone informed him after the fact.>®>

The Office did not locate Rasin in the United States, although the Office confirmed Rasin
had been issued a Florida driver’s license. The Office otherwise was unable to determine the
content and origin of the information he purportedly offered to Stone. Finally, the investigation
did not identify evidence of a connection between the outreach or the meeting and Russian
interference efforts.

b. Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails

After candidate Trump stated on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would “find the
30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaign to find the
deleted Clinton emails.?** Michael Flynn—who would later serve as National Security Advisor in
the Trump Administration—recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly, and Flynn
subsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails.?%

Barbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn. Ledeen, a
long-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn
about her efforts throughout the summer of 2016.266 Smith, an investment advisor who was active
in Republican politics, also attempted to locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails. >’

Ledeen began her efforts to obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn’s request, as early as
December 2015.2% On December 3, 2015, she emailed Smith a proposal to obtain the emails,
stating, “Here is the proposal I briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be
happy to talk with you either in person or over the phone. The person can get the emails which 1.
Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies. That would demonstrate what needs to be
demonstrated.”?%?

Attached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the “Clinton email server was, in
all likelihood, breached long ago,” and that the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services
could “re-assemble the server’s email content.”?”" The proposal called for a three-phase approach.
The first two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with
certain intelligence sources “that have access through liaison work with various foreign services”
to determine if any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted, “Even if a
single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would
be catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]” Smith forwarded the email to two colleagues and

wrote, “we can discuss to whom it should be referred.”?”! On December 16, 2015, Smith informed
Ledeen that he declined to participate in her “initiative.” According to one of Smith’s business
associates, Smith believed Ledeen’s initiative was not viable at that time.?’?

Just weeks after Trump’s July 2016 request to find the Clinton emails, however, Smith
tried to locate and obtain the emails himself. He created a company, raised tens of thousands of
dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others
involved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers
with “ties and affiliations to Russia” who had access to the emails, and that his efforts were
coordinated with the Trump Campaign.?”

On August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject “Sec.
Clinton’s unsecured private email server” to an undisclosed list of recipients, including Campaign
co-chairman Sam Clovis. The email stated that Smith was “[j]ust finishing two days of sensitive
meetings here in DC with involved groups to poke and probe on the above. It is clear that the
Clinton’s home-based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players, and
private mercenaries. Parties with varying interests, are circling to release ahead of the election.”"*

On September 2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KL.S Research LLC
in furtherance of his search for the deleted Clinton emails.*”> One of the purposes of KLS Research
was to manage the funds Smith raised in support of his initiative.”’® KLS Research received over
$30,000 during the presidential campaign, although Smith represented that he raised even more
money.?”’

Smith recruited multiple people for his initiative, including security experts to search for
and authenticate the emails.?’® In early September 2016, as part of his recruitment and fundraising
effort, Smith circulated a document stating that his initiative was “in coordination” with the Trump
Campaign, “to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure organization.”” The document
listed multiple individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, including Flynn, Clovis, Bannon,

and Kellyanne Conway.?®® The investigation established that Smith communicated with at least
Flynn and Clovis about his search for the deleted Clinton emails,”' but the Office did not identify
evidence that any of the listed individuals initiated or directed Smith’s efforts.

In September 2016, Smith and Ledeen got back in touch with each other about their
respective efforts. Ledeen wrote to Smith, “wondering if you had some more detailed reports or
memos or other data you could share because we have come a long way in our efforts since we
last visited. . . . We would need as much technical discussion as possible so we could marry it
against the new data we have found and then could share it back to you ‘your eyes only.”2%

Ledeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the “dark
web”) that purported to be the deleted Clinton emails. Ledeen wanted to authenticate the emails
and solicited contributions to fund that effort. Erik Prince provided funding to hire a tech advisor
to ascertain the authenticity of the emails. According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that
the emails were not authentic.??

A backup of Smith’s computer contained two files that had been downloaded from
WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. The files on
Smith’s computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release
by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect
when the files were downloaded to Smith’s computer. (It appears the creation date was when
WikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section [I1.B.3.c, supra.?**)
The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their
release by WikilLeaks.

Smith continued to send emails to an undisclosed recipient list about Clinton’s deleted
emails until shortly before the election. For example, on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there
was a “tug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days,” and
that WikiLeaks “has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this
allows little time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8.”2%° An attachment to the

operating system that would have preserved that October 2, 2016 creation date when it was downloaded
(no matter what day it was in fact downloaded by Smith). See Volume I, Section IILB.3.c, supra. The
Office tested this theory in March 2019 by downloading the two files found on Smith’s computer from
WikiLeaks’s site using the same Apple operating system on Smith’s computer; both files were successfully
downloaded and retained the October 2, 2016 creation date. See SM-2284941, serial 62.

email claimed that WikiLeaks would release “All 33k deleted Emails” by “November 1st.” No
emails obtained from Clinton’s server were subsequently released.

Smith drafted multiple emails stating or intimating that he was in contact with Russian
hackers. For example, in one such email, Smith claimed that, in August 2016, KLS Research had
organized meetings with parties who had access to the deleted Clinton emails, including parties
with “ties and affiliations to Russia.”?®® The investigation did not identify evidence that any such
meetings occurred. Associates and security experts who worked with Smith on the initiative did
not believe that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers and were aware of no such
connection.?” The investigation did not establish that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers
or that Smith, Ledeen, or other individuals in touch with the Trump Campaign ultimately obtained
the deleted Clinton emails.

In sum, the investigation established that the GRU hacked into email accounts of persons
affiliated with the Clinton Campaign, as well as the computers of the DNC and DCCC. The GRU
then exfiltrated data related to the 2016 election from these accounts and computers, and
disseminated that data through fictitious online personas (DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0) and later
through WikiLeaks. The investigation also established that the Trump Campaign displayed
interest in the WikiLeaks releases, and that [RELUKTNONTTITale M1 (=18

IV. RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS TO AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

The Office identified multiple contacts—*links,” in the words of the Appointment Order—
between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The
Office investigated whether those contacts constituted a third avenue of attempted Russian
interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election. In particular, the investigation
examined whether these contacts involved or resulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the
Trump Campaign and Russia, including with respect to Russia providing assistance to the
Campaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future. Based on the available
information, the investigation did not establish such coordination.

This Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals
with ties to the Russian government, including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates
that have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts. Each subsection begins with an
overview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are
generally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and
extending through the post-election, transition period.

A. Campaign Period (September 2015 — November 8, 2016)

Russian-government-connected individuals and media entities began showing interest in
Trump’s campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015.2%® Because
Trump’s status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and
entertainment dealings, this Office investigated whether a business contact with Russia-linked
individuals and entities during the campaign period—the Trump Tower Moscow project, see
Volume I, Section IV.A.1, infra—TIed to or involved coordination of election assistance.

Outreach from individuals with ties to Russia continued in the spring and summer of 2016,
when Trump was moving toward—and eventually becoming—the Republican nominee for
President. As set forth below, the Office also evaluated a series of links during this period:
outreach to two of Trump’s then-recently named foreign policy advisors, including a
representation that Russia had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails (Volume I,
Sections IV.A.2 & IV.A.3); dealings with a D.C.-based think tank that specializes in Russia and
has connections with its government (Volume I, Section I1V.A.4); a meeting at Trump Tower
between the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on candidate Clinton that was “part of
Russia and its government’s support for [Trump]” (Volume I, Section IV.A.5); events at the
Republican National Convention (Volume I, Section IV.A.6); post-Convention contacts between
Trump Campaign officials and Russia’s ambassador to the United States (Volume I, Section
IV.A.7); and contacts through campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had previously worked for
a Russian oligarch and a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine (Volume I, Section IV.A.8).

 

28 Tor example, on August 18, 2015, on behalf of the editor-in-chief of the internet newspaper
Vzglyad, Georgi Asatryan emailed campaign press secretary Hope Hicks asking for a phone or in-person
candidate interview. 8/18/15 Email, Asatryan to Hicks. One day earlier, the publication’s founder (and
former Russian parliamentarian) Konstantin Rykov had registered two Russian websites—Trump2016.ru
and DonaldTrump2016.ru. No interview took place.

1. Trump Tower Moscow Project

The Trump Organization has pursued and completed projects outside the United States as
part of its real estate portfolio. Some projects have involved the acquisition and ownership
(through subsidiary corporate structures) of property. In other cases, the Trump Organization has
executed licensing deals with real estate developers and management companies, often local to the

country where the project was located.**’

Between at least 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similar licensing deal
in Russia involving the construction of a Trump-branded property in Moscow. The project,
commonly referred to as a “Trump Tower Moscow” or “Trump Moscow” project, anticipated a
combination of commercial, hotel, and residential properties all within the same building.
Between 2013 and June 2016, several employees of the Trump Organization, including then-
president of the organization Donald J. Trump, pursued a Moscow deal with several Russian
counterparties. From the fall of 2015 until the middle of 2016, Michael Cohen spearheaded the
Trump Organization’s pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project, including by reporting on the
project’s status to candidate Trump and other executives in the Trump Organization.>°

a. Trump Tower Moscow Venture with the Crocus Group (2013-2014)

The Trump Organization and the Crocus Group, a Russian real estate conglomerate owned
and controlled by Aras Agalarov, began discussing a Russia-based real estate project shortly after
the conclusion of the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.?’! Donald J. Trump Jr. served as
the primary negotiator on behalf of the Trump Organization; Emin Agalarov (son of Aras
Agalarov) and Irakli “Ike” Kaveladze represented the Crocus Group during negotiations,>** with
the occasional assistance of Robert Goldstone.?*?

In December 2013, Kaveladze and Trump Jr. negotiated and signed preliminary terms of

making false statements to Congress concerning, among other things, the duration of the Trump Tower
Moscow project. See Information § 7(a), United States v. Michael Cohen, 1:18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29,

Miss Universe pageant—which Trump co-owned at the time—was held at the Agalarov-owned Crocus
City Hall in Moscow in November 2013. Both groups were involved in organizing the pageant, and Aras
Agalarov’s son Emin was a musical performer at the event, which Trump attended.

with Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization agreed to accept an arrangement whereby the
organization received a flat 3.5% commission on all sales, with no licensing fees or incentives.?*
The parties negotiated a letter of intent during January and February 2014.2%

From January 2014 through November 2014, the Trump Organization and Crocus Group
discussed development plans for the Moscow project. Some time before January 24, 2014, the
Crocus Group sent the Trump Organization a proposal for a 800-unit, 194-meter building to be -
constructed at an Agalarov-owned site in Moscow called “Crocus City,” which had also been the
site of the Miss Universe pageant.”®” In February 2014, Ivanka Trump met with Emin Agalarov
and toured the Crocus City site during a visit to Moscow.?*® From March 2014 through July 2014,
the groups discussed “design standards” and other architectural elements.*”” For example, in July
2014, members of the Trump Organization sent Crocus Group counterparties questions about the
“demographics of these prospective buyers” in the Crocus City area, the development of
neighboring parcels in Crocus City, and concepts for redesigning portions of the building.*” In
August 2014, the Trump Organization requested specifications for a competing Marriott-branded
tower being built in Crocus City.>%!

Beginning in September 2014, the Trump Organization stopped responding in a timely
fashion to correspondence and proposals from the Crocus Group.’®> Communications between the
two groups continued through November 2014 with decreasing frequency; what appears to be the
last communication is dated November 24, 20143 The project appears not to have developed
past the planning stage, and no construction occurred.

b. Communications with ILC. Expert Investment Company and Giorgi
Riskhiladze (Summer and Fall 2015)

In the late summer of 2015, the Trump Organization received a new inquiry about pursuing
a Trump Tower project in Moscow. In approximately September 2015, Felix Sater, a New York-
based real estate advisor, contacted Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump
Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.’** Sater had previously worked with the
Trump Organization and advised it on a number of domestic and international projects. Sater had
explored the possibility of a Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the Trump
Organization and therefore knew of the organization’s general interest in completing a deal
there.’®® Sater had also served as an informal agent of the Trump Organization in Moscow
previously and had accompanied Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to Moscow in the mid-
2000s.>%

Sater contacted Cohen on behalf of I.C. Expert Investment Company (1.C. Expert), a
Russian real-estate development corporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov.’®” Sater
had known Rozov since approximately 2007 and, in 2014, had served as an agent on behalf of
Rozov during Rozov’s purchase of a building in New York City.**® Sater later contacted Rozov
and proposed that 1.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscow project in which I.C. Expert would
license the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its own.
Sater worked on the deal with Rozov and another employee of I.C. Expert.?®

Cohen was the only Trump Organization representative to negotiate directly with 1.C.
Expert or its agents. In approximately September 2015, Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with
I.C. Expert from candidate Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization. Cohen
provided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016, assuring him
the project was continuing.*'® Cohen also discussed the Trump Moscow project with Ivanka
Trump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project’''y and Donald J.
Trump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project’'?) during the
fall of 2015. |

Also during the fall of 2015, Cohen communicated about the Trump Moscow proposal with
Giorgi Rtskhiladze, a business executive who previously had been involved in a development deal
with the Trump Organization in Batumi, Georgia.’'® Cohen stated that he spoke to Rtskhiladze in
part because Riskhiladze had pursued business ventures in Moscow, including a licensing deal with
the Agalarov-owned Crocus Group.’!'* On September 22, 2015, Cohen forwarded a preliminary
design study for the Trump Moscow project to Ritskhiladze, adding “I look forward to your reply
about this spectacular project in Moscow.” Rtskhiladze forwarded Cohen’s email to an associate
and wrote, “[i]f we could organize the meeting in New York at the highest level of the Russian
Government and Mr. Trump this project would definitely receive the worldwide attention.”*'

On September 24, 2015, Rtskhiladze sent Cohen an attachment that he described as a
proposed “[I]etter to the Mayor of Moscow from Trump org,” explaining that “[w]e need to send
this letter to the Mayor of Moscow (second guy in Russia) he is aware of the potential project and

translation of the letter, which described the Trump Moscow project as a “symbol of stronger
economic, business and cultural relationships between New York and Moscow and therefore
United States and the Russian Federation.”'7 On September 27, 2015, Rtskhiladze sent another
email to Cohen, proposing that the Trump Organization partner on the Trump Moscow project with
“Global Development Group LLC,” which he described as being controlled by Michail Posikhin, a
Russian architect, and Simon Nizharadze.*'® Cohen told the Office that he ultimately declined the
proposal and instead continued to work with I.C. Expert, the company represented by Felix Sater.’'

c. Letter of Intent and Contacts to Russian Government (October 2015-January
2016)

i. Trump Signs the Leiter of Intent on behalf of the Trump Organization

Between approximately October 13, 2015 and November 2, 2015, the Trump Organization
(through its subsidiary Trump Acquisition, LLC) and I.C. Expert completed a letter of intent (LOI)
for a Trump Moscow property. The LOI, signed by Trump for the Trump Organization and Rozov
on behalf of 1.C. Expert, was “intended to facilitate further discussions” in order to “attempt to

approximately 2011, Silk Road Group and the Trump Organization entered info a licensing agreement to
build a Trump-branded property in Batumi, Georgia. Rtskhiladze was also involved in discussions for a

Trumi-branded iroiect in Astana, Kazakhstan. The Office twice interviewed Rtskhiladze, _

enter into a mutually acceptable agreement” related to the Trump-branded project in Moscow.*20
The LOI contemplated a development with residential, hotel, commercial, and office components,
and called for “[a]pproximately 250 first class, luxury residential condominiums,” as well as “[o]ne
first class, luxury hotel consisting of approximately 15 floors and containing not fewer than 150
hotel rooms.”*! For the residential and commercial portions of the project, the Trump
Organization would receive between 1% and 5% of all condominium sales,** plus 3% of all rental
and other revenue.??® For the project’s hotel portion, the Trump Organization would receive a base
fee of 3% of gross operating revenues for the first five years and 4% thereafter, plus a separate
incentive fee of 20% of operating profit. 3** Under the LOI, the Trump Organization also would
receive a $4 million “up-front fee” prior to groundbreaking.**® Under these terms, the Trump
Organization stood to earn substantial sums over the lifetime of the project, without assuming
significant liabilities or financing commitments.**®

On November 3, 2015, the day after the Trump Organization transmitted the LOI, Sater
emailed Cohen suggesting that the Trump Moscow project could be used to increase candidate

Trump’s chances at being elected, writing:

Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of

Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process. . . . Michael, Putin gets on stage
with Donald for a ribbon cutting for Trump Moscow, and Donald owns the republican
nomination. And possibly beats Hillary and our boy is in. . . . We will manage this process

better than anyone. You and I will get Donald and Vladimir on a stage together very
shortly. That the game changer.*’

Later that day, Sater followed up:

Donald doesn’t stare down, he negotiates and understands the economic issues and Putin
only want to deal with a pragmatic leader, and a successful business man is a good
candidate for someone who knows how to negotiate. “Business, politics, whatever it all is
the same for someone who knows how to deal”

I think T can get Putin to say that at the Trump Moscow press conference.

If he says it we own this election. Americas most difficult adversary agreeing that Donald
is a good guy to negotiate. . . .

We can own this election.

Michael my next steps are very sensitive with Putins very very close people, we can pull
this off.

Michael lets go. 2 boys from Brooklyn getting a USA president elected. This is good really
good.*?

According to Cohen, he did not consider the political import of the Trump Moscow project
to the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the time. Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or
anyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump
Moscow project with him. However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the
candidate suggested that his campaign would be a significant “infomercial” for Trump-branded
properties.’?

ii. Post-LOI Contacts with Individuals in Russia

Given the size of the Trump Moscow project, Sater and Cohen believed the project required
approval (whether express or implicit) from the Russian national government, including from the
Presidential Administration of Russia.’*® Sater stated that he therefore began to contact the
Presidential Administration through another Russian business contact.**' In early negotiations
with the Trump Organization, Sater had alluded to the need for government approval and his
attempts to set up meetings with Russian officials. On October 12, 2015, for example, Sater wrote
to Cohen that “all we need is Putin on board and we are golden,” and that a “meeting with Putin
and top deputy is tentatively set for the 14th [of October].”*** this meeting
was being coordinated by associates in Russia and that he had no direct interaction with the Russian
government.**?

Approximately a month later, after the LOI had been signed, Lana Erchova emailed Ivanka
Trump on behalf of Erchova’s then-husband Dmitry Klokov, to offer Klokov’s assistance to the
Trump Campaign.*** Klokov was at that time Director of External Communications for PJISC
Federal Grid Company of Unified Energy System, a large Russian electricity transmission

company, and had been previously employed as an aide and press secretary to Russia’s energy
minister. Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen.**> He told the Office that, after receiving
this inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov’s name and concluded (incorrectly)
that Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter.>*

Between November 18 and 19, 2015, Klokov and Cohen had at least one telephone call
and exchanged several emails. Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a “trusted person” who
could offer the Campaign “political synergy” and “synergy on a government level,” Klokov
recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary.
Klokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the
candidate and an individual Klokov described as “our person of interest.”**” In an email to the
Office, Erchova later identified the “person of interest” as Russian President Vladimir Putin.?**

In the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use
a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local
. developers. Cohen registered his willingness also to meet with Klokov and the unidentified
intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate Trump—
including a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin—would need to be “in
conjunction with the development and an official visit” with the Trump Organization receiving a
formal invitation to visit.”* (Klokov had written previously that “the visit [by candidate Trump
to Russia] has to be informal.”)>%

Klokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over
a possible meeting between Trump and “the person of interest” from any existing business track.**!
Re-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second
email to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have “phenomenal” impact “in a
business dimension” and that the “person of interest[’s]” “most important support” could have
significant ramifications for the “level of projects and their capacity.” Klokov concluded by telling

Cohen that there was “no bigger warranty in any project than [the] consent of the person of
interest.”>*> Cohen rejected the proposal, saying that “[c]urrently our LOI developer is in talks
with VP’s Chief of Staff and arranging a formal invite for the two to meet.”>*® This email appears
to be their final exchange, and the investigation did not identify evidence that Cohen brought
Klokov’s initial offer of assistance to the Campaign’s attention or that anyone associated with the
Trump Organization or the Campaign dealt with Klokov at a later date. Cohen explained that he
did not pursue the proposed meeting because he was already working on the Moscow Project with
Sater, who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.>*

By late December 2015, however, Cohen was complaining that Sater had not been able to
use those connections to set up the promised meeting with Russian government officials. Cohen
told Sater that he was “setting up the meeting myself.”**> On January 11, 2016, Cohen emailed
the office of Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government’s press secretary, indicating that he desired
contact with Sergei Ivanov, Putin’s chief of staff. Cohen erroneously used the email address
“Pr_peskova@prpress.gof.ru” instead of “Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru,” so the email apparently
did not go through®*® On January 14, 2016, Cohen emailed a different address
(info@prpress.gov.ru) with the following message:

Dear Mr. Peskov,

Over the past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding
the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City.

Without getting into lengthy specifics, the communication between our two sides has
stalled. As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance.

[ respectfully request someone, preferably you; contact me so that I might discuss the
specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals.

I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.**’
Two days later, Cohen sent an email to Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru, repeating his request to speak
with Sergei Ivanov.**

Cohen testified to Congress, and initially told the Office, that he did not recall receiving a
response to this email inquiry and that he decided to terminate any further work on the Trump
Moscow project as of January 2016. Cohen later admitted that these statements were false. In

On January 20, 2016, Cohen received an email from Elena Poliakova, Peskov’s personal
assistant. Writing from her personal email account, Poliakova stated that she had been trying to
reach Cohen and asked that he call her on the personal number that she provided. > Shortly after
receiving Poliakova’s email, Cohen called and spoke to her for 20 minutes.>*' Cohen described to
Poliakova his position at the Trump Organization and outlined the proposed Trump Moscow
project, including information about the Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization
had partnered. Cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to
build the project and with financing. According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed questions and
took notes, stating that she would need to follow up with others in Russia,?>?

Cohen could not recall any direct follow-up from Poliakova or from any other
representative of the Russian government, nor did the Office identify any evidence of direct
follow-up. However, the day after Cohen’s call with Poliakova, Sater texted Cohen, asking him
to “[c]all me when you have a few minutes to chat . . . It’s about Putin they called today.”>>* Sater

d. Discussions about Russia Travel by Michael Cohen or Candidate Trump
(December 2015-June 2016)

i. Sater’s Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia

The late January communication was neither the first nor the last time that Cohen
contemplated visiting Russia in pursuit of the Trump Moscow project. Beginning in late 2015,
Sater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump
Organization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing
partners. In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for traveling to
Russia for meetings.>*® On December 19, 2015, Sater wrote:

Please call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line.[**’] He needs a copy of your
and Donald’s passports they need a scan of every page of the passports. Invitations &
Visas will be issued this week by VTB Bank to discuss financing for Trump Tower
Moscow. Politically neither Putins office nor Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot issue
invite, so they are inviting commercially/ business. VTB is Russia’s 2 biggest bank and
VTB Bank CEO Andrey Kostin, will be at all meetings with Putin so that it is a business
meeting not political. We will be invited to Russian consulate this week to receive invite
& have visa issued.**’

[n response, Cohen texted Sater an image of his own passport.*®! Cohen told the Office that at one
point he requested a copy of candidate Trump’s passport from Rhona Graff, Trump’s executive
assistant at the Trump Organization, and that Graff later brought Trump’s passport to Cohen’s

%% Toll records show that Sater was speaking to Evgeny Dvoskin. Call Records of Felix Sater
Dvoskin is an executive of Genbank, a large bank with lending focused
in Crimea, Ukraine. At the time that Sater provided this financing letter to Cohen, Genbank was subject to

Assets Control (Dec. 22, 2015), available at https://www treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-

office.3? The investigation did not, however, establish that the passport was forwarded to Sater.’*

Into the spring of 2016, Sater and Cohen continued to discuss a trip to Moscow in
connection with the Trump Moscow project. On April 20, 2016, Sater wrote Cohen, “[t]he People
~wanted to know when you are coming?”3%* On May 4, 2016, Sater followed up:

I had a chat with Moscow. ASSUMING the trip does happen the question is before or after
the convention. I said I believe, but don't know for sure, that’s it’s probably after the
convention. Obviously the pre-meeting trip (you only) can happen anytime you want but
the 2 big guys where [sic] the question. I said I would confirm and revert. ... Let me
know about If I was right by saying I believe after Cleveland and also when you want to
speak to them and possibly fly over.?®

Cohen responded, “My trip before Cleveland. Trump once he becomes the nominee after the
convention,”*¢®

The day after this exchange, Sater tied Cohen’s travel to Russia to the St. Petersburg
International Economic Forum (“Forum™), an annual event attended by prominent Russian
politicians and businessmen. Sater told the Office that he was informed by a business associate
that Peskov wanted to invite Cohen to the Forum.*®” On May 5, 2016, Sater wrote to Cohen:

Peskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum which is Russia’s
Davos it’s June 16-19. He wants to meet there with you and possibly introduce you to
cither Putin or Medvedev, as they are not sure if 1 or both will be there.

This is perfect. The entire business class of Russia will be there as well.

He said anything you want to discuss including dates and subjects are on the table to
discuss[.]*¢®

The following day, Sater asked Cohen to confirm those dates would work for him to travel; Cohen
wrote back, “[w]orks for me.”3¢

On June 9, 2016, Sater sent Cohen a notice that he (Sater) was completing the badges for
the Forum, adding, “Putin is there on the 17th very strong chance you will meet him as well.”¥"
On June 13, 2016, Sater forwarded Cohen an invitation to the Forum signed by the Director of the
Roscongress Foundation, the Russian entity organizing the Forum.’”' Sater also sent Cohen a
Russian visa application and asked him to send two passport photos.*”? According to Cohen, the
invitation gave no indication that Peskov had been involved in inviting him. Cohen was concerned
that Russian officials were not actually involved or were not interested in meeting with him (as
Sater had alleged), and so he decided not to go to the Forum.*” On June 14, 2016, Cohen met
Sater in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York and informed him that he would not be
traveling at that time.>”*

ii. Candidate Trump’s Opportunities to Travel to Russia

The investigation identified evidence that, during the period the Trump Moscow project
was under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trump visiting Russia arose in two contexts.

First, in interviews with the Office, Cohen stated that he discussed the subject of traveling
to Russia with Trump twice: once in late 2015; and again in spring 2016.>”> According to Cohen,
Trump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project significantly. On one occasion,
Trump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the
candidate’s schedule. Cohen recalled that he spoke with Lewandowski, who suggested that they
speak again when Cohen had actual dates to evaluate. Cohen indicated, however, that he knew
that travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate’s
preexisting commitments to the Campaign.*”8

Second, like Cohen, Trump received and turned down an invitation to the St. Petersburg
International Economic Forum. In late December 2015, Mira Duma—a contact of Ivanka Trump’s
from the fashion industry—first passed along invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump
from Sergei Prikhodko, a Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.’”” On January 14,
2016, Rhona Graff sent an email to Duma stating that Trump was “honored to be asked to
participate in the highly prestigious” Forum event, but that he would “have to decline” the
invitation given his “very grueling and full travel schedule” as a presidential candidate.’”® Graff

Attorpey-WotlcPreduet // Ma

asked Duma whether she recommended that Graff “send a formal note to the Deputy Prime
Minister” declining his invitation; Duma replied that a formal note would be “great.””

It does not appear that Graff prepared that note immediately. According to written answers
from President Trump,*®® Graff received an email from Deputy Prime Minister Prikhodko on
March 17, 2016, again inviting Trump to participate in the 2016 Forum in St. Petersburg.”®' Two
weeks later, on March 31, 2016, Graff prepared for Trump’s signature a two-paragraph letter
declining the invitation.”® The letter stated that Trump’s “schedule has become extremely
demanding” because of the presidential campaign, that he “already ha[d] several commitments in
the United States” for the time of the Forum, but that he otherwise “would have gladly given every
consideration to attending such an important event.”*** Graff forwarded the letter to another
executive assistant at the Trump Organization with instructions to print the document on letterhead
for Trump to sign.’®

At approximately the same time that the letter was being prepared, Robert Foresman—a

presidential aide involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speak at the
Forum.*® Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction
brokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the television show The
Apprentice). In his email, Foresman referenced his long-standing personal and professional
expertise in Russia and Ukraine, his work setting up an early “private channel” between Vladimir
Putin and former U.S. President George W. Bush, and an “approach” he had received from “senior
Kremlin officials” about the candidate. Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate,
Corey Lewandowski, or “another relevant person” to discuss this and other “concrete things”
Foresman felt uncomfortable discussing over “unsecure email.”®%® On April 4, 2016, Graff

With no response forthcoming, Foresman twice sent reminders to Graff—first on April 26
and again on April 30, 2016.°# Graff sent an apology to Foresman and forwarded his April 26
email (as well as his initial March 2016 email) to Lewandowski.®® On May 2, 2016, Graff
forwarded Foresman’s April 30 email—which suggested an alternative meeting with Donald
Trump Jr. or Eric Trump so that Foresman could convey to them information that “should be
conveyed to [the candidate] personally or [to] someone [the candidate] absolutely trusts”—to
policy advisor Stephen Miller.>*?

No communications or other evidence obtained by the Office indicate that the Trump
Campaign learned that Foresman was reaching out to invite the candidate to the Forum or that the
Campaign otherwise followed up with Foresman until after the election, when he interacted with
the Transition Team as he pursued a possible position in the incoming Administration.*”! When
interviewed by the Office, Foresman denied that the specific “approach” from “senior Kremlin
officials” noted in his March 31, 2016 email was anything other than Kobyakov’s invitation to
Roscongress. According to Foresman, the “concrete things” he referenced in the same email were
a combination of the invitation itself, Foresman’s personal perspectives on the invitation and
Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest
Institute). Foresman told the Office that Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him
to another Republican presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that
Kobyakov had asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate
withdrew from the race and the other politician’s participation did not work out.**> Finally,
Foresman claimed to have no plans to establish a back channel involving Trump, stating the
reference to his involvement in the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnish his credentials
to the Campaign. Foresman commented that he had not recognized any of the experts announced
as Trump’s foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with
the candidate to share his professional background and policy views, including that Trump should
decline Kobyakov’s invitation to speak at the Forum.**

2016 to early October 2016.>°* 1In late April 2016, Papadopoulos was told by London-based
professor Joseph Mifsud, immediately after Mifsud’s return from a trip to Moscow, that the
Russian government had obtained “dirt” on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.
One week later, on May 6, 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign
government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that
it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be
damaging to candidate Clinton.

Papadopoulos shared information about Russian “dirt” with people outside of the
Campaign, and the Office investigated whether he also provided it to a Campaign official.
Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom he interacted told the Office that they did
not recall that Papadopoulos passed them the information. Throughout the relevant period of time
and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals
to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. That meeting never
came to pass.

a. Origins of Campaign Work

In March 2016, Papadopoulos became a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.*®
As early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign but, in
a September 30, 2015 email, he was told that the Campaign was not hiring policy advisors.**® In
late 2015, Papadopoulos obtained a paid position on the campaign of Republican presidential
candidate Ben Carson.>”’

Although Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 2016, Papadopoulos
had stopped actively working for his campaign by early February 2016.*® At that time,
Papadopoulos reached out to a contact at the London Centre of International Law Practice
(LCILP), which billed itself as a “unique institution . . . comprising high-level professional
international law practitioners, dedicated to the advancement of global legal knowledge and the
practice of international law.”**” Papadopoulos said that he had finished his role with the Carson

a January 2017 FBI interview about, infer alia, the timing, extent, and nature of his interactions and
communications with Joseph Mifsud and two Russian nationals: Olga Polonskaya and Ivan Timofeev.
Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to an information charging him with
making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a).

campaign and asked if LCILP was hiring.**® In early February, Papadopoulos agreed to join
LCILP and arrived in London to begin work.*"!

As he was taking his position at LCILP, Papadopoulos contacted Trump campaign manager
Corey Lewandowski via LinkedIn and emailed campaign official Michael Glassner about his
interest in joining the Trump Campaign.*?> On March 2, 2016, Papadopoulos sent Glassner
another message reiterating his interest.*”® Glassner passed along word of Papadopoulos’s interest
to another campaign official, Joy Lutes, who notified Papadopoulos by email that she had been
told by Glassner to introduce Papadopoulos to Sam Clovis, the Trump Campaign’s national co-
chair and chief policy advisor.*™*

At the time of Papadopoulos’s March 2 email, the media was criticizing the Trump
Campaign for lack of experienced foreign policy or national security advisors within its ranks.*®
To address that issue, senior Campaign officials asked Clovis to put a foreign policy team together
on short notice.® After receiving Papadopoulos’s name from Lutes, Clovis performed a Google
search on Papadopoulos, learned that he had worked at the Hudson Institute, and believed that he
had credibility on energy issues.*” On March 3, 2016, Clovis arranged to speak with
Papadopoulos by phone to discuss Papadopoulos joining the Campaign as a foreign policy advisor,
and on March 6, 2016, the two spoke.*® Papadopoulos recalled that Russia was mentioned as a
topic, and he understood from the conversation that Russia would be an important aspect of the
Campaign’s foreign policy.*”® At the end of the conversation, Clovis offered Papadopoulos a role
as a foreign policy advisor to the Campaign, and Papadopoulos accepted the offer.*!

to Rome, Italy, as part of his duties with LCILP.*!! The purpose of the trip was to meet officials
affiliated with Link Campus University, a for-profit institution headed by a former Italian
government official.*'> During the visit, Papadopoulos was introduced to Joseph Mifsud.

Mifsud is a Maltese national who worked as a professor at the London Academy of
Diplomacy in London, England.*® Although Mifsud worked out of London and was also affiliated
with LCILP, the encounter in Rome was the first time that Papadopoulos met him.*'* Mifsud
maintained various Russian contacts while living in London, as described further below. Among
his contacts was _,415 a one-time employee of the IRA, the entity that carried out
the Russian social media campaign (see Volume I, Section II, supra). In January and February
2016, Mifsud and - discussed _ possibly meeting in Russia. The
investigation did not identify evidence of them meeting. Later, in the spring of 2016,
was also in contact that was linked to an employee of the Russian
Ministry of Defense, and that account had overlapping contacts with a group of Russian military-
controlled Facebook accounts that included accounts used to promote the DCLeaks releases in the
course of the GRU’s hack-and-release operations (see Volume I, Section II1.B.1, supra).

According to Papadopoulos, Mifsud at first seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos when
they met in Rome.*'® After Papadopoulos informed Mifsud about his role in the Trump Campaign,
however, Mifsud appeared to take greater interest in Papadopoulos.”’” The two discussed Mifsud’s
European and Russian contacts and had a general discussion about Russia; Mifsud also offered to
introduce Papadopoulos to European leaders and others with contacts to the Russian
government.*'® Papadopoulos told the Office that Mifsud’s claim of substantial connections with
Russian government officials interested Papadopoulos, who thought that such connections could
increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.*’

On March 17, 2016, Papadopoulos returned to London.*”® Four days later, candidate
Trump publicly named him as a member of the foreign policy and national security advisory team
chaired by Senator Jeff Sessions, describing Papadopoulos as “an oil and energy consultant” and
an “[e]xcellent guy.”*!

On March 24, 2016, Papadopoulos met with Mifsud in London.**? Mifsud was
accompanied by a Russian female named Olga Polonskaya. Mifsud introduced Polonskaya as a
former student of his who had connections to Vladimir Putin.** Papadopoulos understood at the
time that Polonskaya may have been Putin’s niece but later learned that this was not true.”* During
the meeting, Polonskaya offered to help Papadopoulos establish contacts in Russia and stated that
the Russian ambassador in London was a friend of hers.*”> Based on this interaction, Papadopoulos
expected Mifsud and Polonskaya to introduce him to the Russian ambassador in London, but that
did not occur.*®

Following his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos sent an email to members of the Trump
Campaign’s foreign policy advisory team. The subject line of the message was “Meeting with
Russian leadership--including Putin.”**” The message stated in pertinent part:

[ just finished a very productive lunch with a good friend of mine, Joseph Mifsud, the
director of the London Academy of Diplomacy--who introduced me to both Putin’s niece
and the Russian Ambassador in London--who also acts as the Deputy Foreign Minister."**

The topic of the lunch was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to
discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump. They are keen to host us in a “neutral”
city, or directly in Moscow. They said the leadership, including Putin, is ready to meet with
us and Mr. Trump should there be interest. Waiting for everyone’s thoughts on moving
forward with this very important issue.*’

Papadopoulos’s message came at a time when Clovis perceived a shift in the Campaign’s approach

 

Clovis’s response to Papadopoulos, however, did not reflect that shift. Replying to
Papadopoulos and the other members of the foreign policy advisory team copied on the initial
email, Clovis wrote:

This is most informative. Let me work it through the campaign. No commitments until we
see how this plays out. My thought is that we probably should not go forward with any
meetings with the Russians until we have had occasion to sit with our NATO allies,
especially France, Germany and Great Britain. We need to reassure our allies that we are
not going to advance anything with Russia until we have everyone on the same page.

More thoughts later today. Great work.**!

The Campaign held a meeting of the foreign policy advisory team with Senator Sessions
and candidate Trump approximately one week later, on March 31, 2016, in Washington, D.C.**
The meeting—which was intended to generate press coverage for the Campaign®*—took place at
the Trump International Hotel.** Papadopoulos flew to Washington for the event. At the meeting,

March 31, 2016 Meeting of Foreign Policy Team, with Papadopoulos (Fourth fiom Right of Candidate Trump)

During the meeting, each of the newly announced foreign policy advisors introduced
themselves and briefly described their areas of experience or expertise.**> Papadopoulos spoke
about his previous work in the energy sector and then brought up a potential meeting with Russian
officials.**® Specifically, Papadopoulos told the group that he had learned through his contacts in
London that Putin wanted to meet with candidate Trump and that these connections could help
arrange that meeting.**’

Trump and Sessions both reacted to Papadopoulos’s statement. Papadopoulos and
Campaign advisor J.D. Gordon—who told investigators in an interview that he had a “crystal
clear” recollection of the meeting—have stated that Trump was interested in and receptive to the
idea of a meeting with Putin.**® Papadopoulos understood Sessions to be similarly supportive of
his efforts to arrange a meeting.**” Gordon and two other attendees, however, recall that Sessions
generally opposed the proposal, though they differ in their accounts of the concerns he voiced or
the strength of the opposition he expressed.*

making further efforts to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government.
To the contrary, Papadopoulos told the Office that he understood the Campaign to be supportive
of his efforts to arrange such a meeting.! Accordingly, when he returned to London,
Papadopoulos resumed those efforts.*?

Throughout April 2016, Papadopoulos continued to correspond with, meet with, and seek
Russia contacts through Mifsud and, at times, Polonskaya.*** For example, within a week of her
initial March 24 meeting with him, Polonskaya attempted to send Papadopoulos a text message—
which email exchanges show to have been drafted or edited by Mifsud—addressing
Papadopoulos’s “wish to engage with the Russian Federation.”*** When Papadopoulos learned
from Mifsud that Polonskaya had tried to message him, he sent her an email seecking another
meeting.*** Polonskaya responded the next day that she was “back in St. Petersburg” but “would
be very pleased to support [Papadopoulos’s] initiatives between our two countries” and “to meet
[him] again.”**¢ Papadopoulos stated in reply that he thought “a good step” would be to introduce
him to “the Russian Ambassador in London,” and that he would like to talk to the ambassador, “or
anyone else you recommend, about a potential foreign policy trip to Russia.”*4’

Mifsud, who had been copied on the email exchanges, replied on the morning of April 11,
2016. He wrote, “This is already been agreed. I am flying to Moscow on the 18th for a Valdai
meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma. We will talk tomorrow.”**?® The two bodies referenced
by Mifsud are part of or associated with the Russian government: the Duma is a Russian legislative
assembly,** while “Valdai” refers to the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based group that “is
close to Russia’s foreign-policy establishment.”**® Papadopoulos thanked Mifsud and said that he
would see him “tomorrow.”**! For her part, Polonskaya responded that she had “already alerted
my personal links to our conversation and your request,” that “we are all very excited the
possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” and that “[t]he Russian Federation would love
to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.”**

Papadopoulos’s and Mifsud’s mentions of seeing each other “tomorrow” referenced a

London. Papadopoulos acknowledged the meeting during interviews with the Office,*** and
records from Papadopoulos’s UK cellphone and his internet-search history all indicate that the
meeting took place.**

Following the meeting, Mifsud traveled as planned to Moscow.** On April 18, 2016,
while in Russia, Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email to Ivan Timofeev, a member of the
Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC).*® Mifsud had described Timofeev as having
connections with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA),*’ the executive entity in Russia
responsible for Russian foreign relations.**® Over the next several weeks, Papadopoulos and
Timofeev had multiple conversations over Skype and email about setting “the groundwork” for a
“potential” meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.*** Papadopoulos
told the Office that, on one Skype call, he believed that his conversation with Timofeev was being
monitored or supervised by an unknown third party, because Timofeev spoke in an official manner
and Papadopoulos heard odd noises on the line.*® Timofeev also told Papadopoulos in an April
25, 2016 email that he had just spoken “to Igor Ivanov[,] the President of RIAC and former Foreign
Minister of Russia,” and conveyed Ivanov’s advice about how best to arrange a “Moscow visit.”*¢!

meeting).*> During that meeting, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had met with high-level
Russian government officials during his recent trip to Moscow. Mifsud also said that, on the trip,
he learned that the Russians had obtained “dirt” on candidate Hillary Clinton. As Papadopoulos
later stated to the FBI, Mifsud said that the “dirt” was in the form of “emails of Clinton,” and that
they “have thousands of emails.”*** On May 6, 2016, 10 days after that meeting with Mifsud,
Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had
received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the
anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.*6®

e. Russia-Related Communications With The Campaign

While he was discussing with his foreign contacts a potential meeting of campaign officials
with Russian government officials, Papadopoulos kept campaign officials apprised of his efforts.
On April 25, 2016, the day before Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the emails, Papadopoulos wrote
to senior policy advisor Stephen Miller that “[t]he Russian government has an open invitation by
Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready,” and that “[t]he advantage of being in London
is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in ‘neutral’ cities.”**® On April 27, 2016,
after his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos wrote a second message to Miller stating that “some
interesting messages [were] coming in from Moscow about a ttip when the time is right.”**” The
same day, Papadopoulos sent a similar email to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, telling
Lewandowski that Papadopoulos had “been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin
wanting to host [Trump] and the team when the time is right.”*¢8

Papadopoulos’s Russia-related communications with Campaign officials continued
throughout the spring and summer of 2016. On May 4, 2016, he forwarded to Lewandowski an
email from Timofeev raising the possibility of a meeting in Moscow, asking Lewandowski
whether that was “something we want to move forward with.”**° The next day, Papadopoulos
forwarded the same Timofeev email to Sam Clovis, adding to the top of the email “Russia
update.”"’® He included the same email in a May 21, 2016 message to senior Campaign official
Paul Manafort, under the subject line “Request from Russia to meet Mr. Trump,” stating that
“Russia has been cager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me

Papadopoulos, and stated: “Let[’]s discuss. We need someone to communicate that [Trump] is
not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the Campaign so as not to send
any signal.”*”?

On June 1, 2016, Papadopoulos replied to an earlier email chain with Lewandowski about
a Russia visit, asking if Lewandowski “want[ed] to have a call about this topic” and whether “we
were following up with it.”*® After Lewandowski told Papadopoulos to “connect with” Clovis
because he was “running point,” Papadopoulos emailed Clovis that “the Russian MFA” was asking
him “if Mr. Trump is interested in visiting Russia at some point.”*”* Papadopoulos wrote in an
email that he “[w]anted to pass this info along to you for you to decide what’s best to do with it
and what message I should send (or to ignore).”*”

After several email and Skype exchanges with Timofeev,"”® Papadopoulos sent one more
email to Lewandowski on June 19, 2016, Lewandowski’s last day as campaign manager.*”’ The
email stated that “[t]he Russian ministry of foreign affairs” had contacted him and asked whether,
if Mr. Trump could not travel to Russia, a campaign representative such as Papadopoulos could
attend meetings.*’® Papadopoulos told Lewandowski that he was “willing to make the trip off the
record if it’s in the interest of Mr. Trump and the campaign to meet specific people.””

Following Lewandowski’s departure from the Campaign, Papadopoulos communicated
with Clovis and Walid Phares, another member of the foreign policy advisory team, about an off-
the-record meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials or with
Papadopoulos’s other Russia connections, Mifsud and Timofeev.“® Papadopoulos also interacted

Attorney—WorlcProduet // Ma

Papadopoulos was dismissed from the Trump Campaign in early October 2016, after an
interview he gave to the Russian news agency Inferfax generated adverse publicity.*

f- Trump Campaign Knowledge of “Dirt”

Papadopoulos admitted telling at least one individual outside of the Campaign—
specifically, the then-Greek foreign minister—about Russia’s obtaining Clinton-related emails.*”
In addition, a different foreign government informed the FBI that, 10 days after meeting with
Mifsud in late April 2016, Papadopoulos suggested that the Trump Campaign had received
indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous
release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.*** (This conversation occurred
after the GRU spearphished Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta and stole his emails, and
the GRU hacked into the DCCC and DNC, see Volume I, Sections IIL.A & IIL.B, supra.) Such
disclosures raised questions about whether Papadopoulos informed any Trump Campaign official
about the emails.

When interviewed, Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials who interacted with him told
the Office that they could not recall Papadopoulos’s sharing the information that Russia had
obtained “dirt” on candidate Clinton in the form of emails or that Russia could assist the Campaign
through the anonymous release of information about Clinton. Papadopoulos stated that he could
not clearly recall having told anyone on the Campaign and wavered about whether he accurately
remembered an incident in which Clovis had been upset after hearing Papadopoulos tell Clovis
that Papadopoulos thought “they have her emails.”*® The Campaign officials who interacted or
corresponded with Papadopoulos have similarly stated, with varying degrees of certainty, that he
did not tell them. Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, for example, did not remember hearing
anything from Papadopoulos or Clovis about Russia having emails of or dirt on candidate
Clinton.**® Clovis stated that he did not recall anyone, including Papadopoulos, having given him
non-public information that a foreign government might be in possession of material damaging to

Clinton.”’

No documentary evidence, and nothing in the email accounts or other
communications facilities reviewed by the Office, shows that Papadopoulos shared this
information with the Campaign.

g. Additional George Papadopoulos Contact

The Office investigated another Russia-related contact with Papadopoulos. The Office was
not fully able to explore the contact because the individual at issue—Sergei Millian—remained
out of the country since the inception of our investigation and declined to meet with members of
the Office despite our repeated efforts to obtain an interview.

Papadopoulos first connected with Millian via LinkedIn on July 15, 2016, shortly after
Papadopoulos had attended the TAG Summit with Clovis.*® Millian, an American citizen who is
a native of Belarus, introduced himself “as president of [the] New York-based Russian American
Chamber of Commerce,” and claimed that through that position he had “insider knowledge and
direct access to the top hierarchy in Russian politics.”*"! Papadopoulos asked Timofeev whether
he had heard of Millian.*? Although Timofeev said no,”* Papadopoulos met Millian in New York
City.’** The meetings took place on July 30 and August 1, 2016.°® Afterwards, Millian invited
Papadopoulos to attend—and potentially speak at—two international energy conferences,
including one that was to be held in Moscow in September 2016.°° Papadopoulos ultimately did
not attend either conference.

On July 31, 2016, following his first in-person meeting with Millian, Papadopoulos
emailed Trump Campaign official Bo Denysyk to say that he had been contacted “by some leaders
of Russian-American voters here in the US about their interest in voting for Mr. Trump,” and to
ask whether he should “put you in touch with their group (US-Russia chamber of commerce).”"
Denysyk thanked Papadopoulos “for taking the initiative,” but asked him to “hold off with

On November 9, 2016, shortly after the election, Papadopoulos atranged to meet Millian

who are not under sanctions.”!! The meeting took place on November 14, 2016, at the Trump
Hotel and Tower in Chicago.’'? According to Papadopoulos, the two men discussed partnering on
business deals, but Papadopoulos perceived that Millian’s attitude toward him changed when
Papadopoulos stated that he was only pursuing private-sector opportunities and was not interested
in a job in the Administration.®'® The two remained in contact, however, and had extended online

Carter Page worked for the Trump Campaign from January 2016 to September 2016. He
was formally and publicly announced as a foreign policy advisor by the candidate in March
2016.°'® Page had lived and worked in Russia, and he had been approached by Russian intelligence
officers several years before he volunteered for the Trump Campaign. During his time with the
Campaign, Page advocated pro-Russia foreign policy positions and traveled to Moscow in his
personal capacity. Russian intelligence officials had formed relationships with Page in 2008 and
2013 and Russian officials may have focused on Page in 2016 because of his affiliation with the
Campaign. However, the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian
government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

In communications with Campaign officials, Page also repeatedly touted his high-level
contacts in Russia and his ability to forge connections between candidate Trump and senior
Russian governmental officials. For example, on January 30, 2016, Page sent an email to senior
Campaign officials stating that he had “spent the past week in Europe and ha[d] been in discussions
with some individuals with close ties to the Kremlin” who recognized that Trump could have a
“game-changing effect . . . in bringing the end of the new Cold War.”*** The email stated that
“[tJhrough [his] discussions with these high level contacts,” Page believed that “a direct meeting
in Moscow between Mr[.] Trump and Putin could be arranged.”** Page closed the email b

example, in April 2016, Page provided feedback on an outline for a foreign policy speech that the
candidate gave at the Mayflower Hotel,**’ see Volume I, Section IV.A 4, infra. In May 2016, Page
prepared an outline of an energy policy speech for the Campaign and then traveled to Bismarck,
North Dakota, to watch the candidate deliver the speech.®*® Chief policy advisor Sam Clovis

expressed appreciation for Page’s work and praised his work to other Campaign officials.***

Page’s affiliation with the Trump Campaign took on a higher profile and drew the attention

New Economic School (NES) in Moscow.”® The NES commencement ceremony generally
featured high-profile speakers; for example, President Barack Obama delivered a commencement
address at the school in 2009.%3! NES officials told the Office that the interest in inviting Page to
speak at NES was based entirely on his status as a Trump Campaign advisor who served as the
candidate’s Russia expert.>*?> Andrej Krickovic, an associate of Page’s and assistant professor at
the Higher School of Economics in Russia, recommended that NES rector Shlomo Weber invite
Page to give the commencement address based on his connection to the Trump Campaign.**®
Denis Klimentov, an employee of NES, said that when Russians learned of Page’s involvement in
the Trump Campaign in March 2016, the excitement was palpable.”** Weber recalled that in
summer 2016 there was substantial interest in the Trump Campaign in Moscow, and he felt that
bringing a member of the Campaign to the school would be beneficial.”>

Page was eager to accept the invitation to speak at NES, and he sought approval from
Trump Campaign officials to make the trip to Russia.’® On May 16, 2016, while that request was
still under consideration, Page emailed Clovis, J.D. Gordon, and Walid Phares and suggested that
candidate Trump take his place speaking at the commencement ceremony in Moscow.>*” On June
19, 2016, Page followed up again to request approval to speak at the NES event and to reiterate
that NES “would love to have Mr. Trump speak at this annual celebration” in Page’s place.>®
Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski responded the same day, saying, “If you want to do this,
it would be out side [sic] of your role with the DJT for President campaign. 1 am certain Mr.
Trump will not be able to attend.”>*

In early July 2016, Page traveled to Russia for the NES events. On July 5, 2016, Denis
Klimentov, copying his brother, Dmitri Klimentov,**® emailed Maria Zakharova, the Director of
the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Information and Press Department, about Page’s visit and
his connection to the Trump Campaign.’®! Denis Klimentov said in the email that he wanted to

Klimentov then contacted Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov about Page’s visit to see if
Peskov wanted to introduce Page to any Russian government officials.’®* The following day,
Peskov responded to what appears to have been the same Denis Klimentov-Zakharova email
thread. Peskov wrote, “I have read about [Page]. Specialists say that he is far from being the main
one. So I better not initiate a meeting in the Kremlin.”%®

On July 7, 2016, Page delivered the first of his two speeches in Moscow at NES.**® In the
speech, Page criticized the U.S. government’s foreign policy toward Russia, stating that

hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.”®’

stated he would send “a readout soon regarding some incredible insights and outreach I’ ve received
from a few Russian legislators and senior members of the Presidential Administration here.”*"”
On July 9, 2016, Page emailed Clovis, writing in pertinent part:

Russian Deputy Prime minister and NES board member Arkady Dvorkovich also spoke
before the event. In a private conversation, Dvorkovich expressed strong support for Mr.
Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the
vast range of current international problems. Based on feedback from a diverse array of
other sources close to the Presidential Administration, it was readily apparent that this
sentiment is widely held at all levels of government.>”®

Despite these representations to the Campaign,

   

The Office was unable to obtain additional evidence or testimony about who Page
may have met or communicated with in Moscow; thus, Page’s activities in Russia—as described

d. Later Campaign Work and Removal from the Campaign

In July 2016, after returning from Russia, Page traveled to the Republican National
Convention in Cleveland.’®® While there, Page met Russian Ambassador to the United States
Sergey Kislyak; that interaction is described in Volume I, Section IV.A.6.a, infra.®®® Page later
emailed Campaign officials with feedback he said he received from ambassadors he had met at the
Convention, and he wrote that Ambassador Kislyak was very worried about candidate Clinton’s
world views.**®

   

Following the Convention, Page’s trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russia foreign
policy drew the media’s attention and began to generate substantial press coverage. The Campaign
responded by distancing itself from Page, describing him as an “informal foreign policy advisor”
who did “not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.”®®’ On September 23, 2016, Yahoo! News
reported that U.S. intelligence officials were investigating whether Page had opened private
communications with senior Russian officials to discuss U.S. sanctions policy under a possible
Trump Administration.”®® A Campaign spokesman told Yahoo! News that Page had “no role” in
the Campaign and that the Campaign was “not aware of any of his activities, past or present.””%’
On September 24, 2016, Page was formally removed from the Campaign.>®

Although Page had been removed from the Campaign, after the election he sought a
position in the Trump Administration.””! On November 14, 2016, he submitted an application to
the Transition Team that inflated his credentials and experiences, stating that in his capacity as a
Trump Campaign foreign policy advisor he had met with “top world leaders” and “effectively

4. Dimitri Simes and the Center for the National Interest

Members of the Trump Campaign interacted on several occasions with the Center for the
National Interest (CNI), principally through its President and Chief Executive Officer, Dimitri
Simes. CNI is a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian government. Simes
was born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s. In April
2016, candidate Trump delivered his first speech on foreign policy and national security at an event
hosted by the National Interest, a publication affiliated with CNI. Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and
Russian Ambassador Kislyak both attended the event and, as a result, it gained some attention in
relation to Sessions’s confirmation hearings to become Attorney General. Sessions had various
other contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including Russia.
Jared Kushner also interacted with Simes about Russian issues during the campaign. The
investigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messages to or
from the Russian government through CNI or Simes.

a. CNI and Dimitri Simes Connect with the Trump Campaign

CNI is a Washington-based non-profit organization that grew out of a center founded by
former President Richard Nixon.”®® CNI describes itself “as a voice for strategic realism in U.S.
foreign policy,” and publishes a bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, the National Interest.>** CNI
is overseen by a board of directors and an advisory council that is largely honorary and whose
members at the relevant time included Sessions, who served as an advisor to candidate Trump on
national security and foreign policy issues.’

Dimitri Simes is president and CEO of CNI and the publisher and CEO of the National
Interest.5% Simes was born in the former Soviet Union, emigrated to the United States in the early
1970s, and joined CNI’s predecessor after working at the Carnegie Endowment for International

Peace.””” Simes personally has many contacts with current and former Russian government
officials,’®® as does CNI collectively. As CNI stated when seeking a grant from the Carnegie
Corporation in 2015, CNI has “unparalleled access to Russian officials and politicians among
Washington think tanks,”>* in part because CNT has arranged for U.S. delegations to visit Russia
and for Russian delegations to visit the United States as part of so-called “Track II”” diplomatic
‘efforts. 5%

On March 14, 2016, CNI board member Richard Plepler organized a luncheon for CNI and
its honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York.®”' The idea
behind the event was to generate interest in CNI’s work and recruit new board members for CNI.5%
Along with Simes, attendees at the event included Jared Kushner, son-in-law of candidate
Trump.5% Kushner told the Office that the event came at a time when the Trump Campaign was
having trouble securing support from experienced foreign policy professionals and that, as a result,
he decided to seek Simes’s assistance during the March 14 event.5%*

Simes and Kushner spoke again on a March 24, 2016 telephone call,’”® three days after
Trump had publicly named the team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short
notice.’% On March 31, 2016, Simes and Kushner had an in-person, one-on-one meeting in
Kushner’s New York office.®’” During that meeting, Simes told Kushner that the best way to
handle foreign-policy issues for the Trump Campaign would be to organize an advisory group of
experts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent
with Trump’s voice.5® Simes believed that Kushner was receptive to that suggestion.”

Simes also had contact with other individuals associated with the Trump Campaign
regarding the Campaign’s foreign policy positions. For example, on June 17, 2016, Simes sent
1.D. Gordon an email with a “memo to Senator Sessions that we discussed at our recent meeting”

and asked Gordon to both read it and share it with Sessions. The memorandum proposed building
a “small and carefully selected group of experts” to assist Sessions with the Campaign, operating
under the assumption “that Hillary Clinton is very vulnerable on national security and foreign
policy issues.” The memorandum outlined key issues for the Campaign, including a “new
beginning with Russia.”®!?

b. National Interest Hosts a Foreign Policy Speech at the Mayflower Hotel

During both their March 24 phone call and their March 31 in-person mecting, Simes and
Kushner discussed the possibility of CNI hosting a foreign policy speech by candidate Trump.®!!
Following those conversations, Simes agreed that he and others associated with CNI would
provide behind-the-scenes input on the substance of the foreign-policy speech and that CNI
officials would coordinate the logistics of the speech with Sessions and his staff, including
Sessions’s chief of staff, Rick Dearborn.!?

In mid-April 2016, Kushner put Simes in contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller
and forwarded to Simes an outline of the foreign-policy speech that Miller had prepared.®’® Simes
sent back to the Campaign bullet points with ideas for the speech that he had drafted with CNI
Executive Director Paul Saunders and board member Richard Burt.®* Simes received subsequent
draft outlines from Miller, and he and Saunders spoke to Miller by phone about substantive
changes to the speech.’' It is not clear, however, whether CNI officials received an actual draft
of the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actual draft, Simes did not,
and the emails that CNI produced to this Office do not contain such a draft.*'®

After board members expressed concern to Simes that CNI's hosting the speech could be
perceived as an endorsement of a particular candidate, CNI decided to have its publication, the
National Interest, serve as the host and to have the event at the National Press Club.®’” Kushner
later requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was another venue that
Simes had mentioned during initial discussions with the Campaign, in order to address concerns
about security and capacity.5'®

On April 25, 2016, Saunders booked event rooms at the Mayflower to host both the speech
and a VIP reception that was to be held beforehand.’'® Saunders understood that the reception—
at which invitees would have the chance to meet candidate Trump—would be a small event.*?
Saunders decided who would attend by looking at the list of CNI’s invitees to the speech itself and
then choosing a subset for the reception.®*! CNI’s invitees to the reception included Sessions and
Kislyak.®2 The week before the speech Simes had informed Kislyak that he would be invited to
the speech, and that he would have the opportunity to meet Trump.*>

When the pre-speech reception began on April 27, a receiving line was quickly organized
so that attendees could meet Trump.®** Sessions first stood next to Trump to introduce him to the
members of Congress who were in attendance.’” After those members had been introduced,
Simes stood next to Trump and introduced him to the CNI invitees in attendance, including
Kislyak.®?® Simes perceived the introduction to be positive and friendly, but thought it clear that
Kislyak and Trump had just met for the first time.®?” Kislyak also met Kushner during the pre-
speech reception. The two shook hands and chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner
recalled Kislyak saying, “we like what your candidate is saying . . . it’s refreshing.”**

Several public reports state that, in addition to speaking to Kushner at the pre-speech
reception, Kislyak also met or conversed with Sessions at that time.*” Sessions stated to
investigators, however, that he did not remember any such conversation.*** Nor did anyone else
affiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between
Sessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception.®*! It appears that, if a conversation occurred at
the pre-speech reception, it was a brief one conducted in public view, similar to the exchange
between Kushner and Kislyak.

The Office found no evidence that Kislyak conversed with either Trump or Sessions after
the speech, or would have had the opportunity to do so. Simes, for example, did not recall seeing
Kislyak at the post-speech luncheon,®* and the only witness who accounted for Sessions’s
whereabouts stated that Sessions may have spoken to the press after the event but then departed
for Capitol Hill.*** Saunders recalled, based in part on a food-related request he received from a
Campaiﬁgil staff member, that Trump left the hotel a few minutes after the speech to go to the
airport.®?

c. Jeff Sessions’s Post-Speech Interactions with CNI

In the wake of Sessions’s confirmation hearings as Attorney General, questions arose about
whether Sessions’s campaign-period interactions with CNI apart from the Mayflower speech

With respect to Kislyak contacts, on May 23, 2016, Sessions attended CNI’s Distinguished Service
Award dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C.%* Sessions attended a pre-dinner
reception and was seated at one of two head tables for the event.”*® A seating chart prepared by
Saunders indicates that Sessions was scheduled to be seated next to Kislyak, who appears to have
responded to the invitation by indicating he would attend the event.®” Sessions, however, did not
remember seeing, speaking with, or sitting next to Kislyak at the dinner.*® Although CNI board
member Charles Boyd said he may have seen Kislyak at the dinner,%*® Simes, Saunders, and Jacob

23 event.** Kislyak also does not appear in any of the photos from the event that the Office
obtained.

d. Jared Kushner’s Continuing Contacts with Simes

Between the April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel and the presidential election, Jared
Kushner had periodic contacts with Simes.®*® Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings
and phone conversations, which concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the
Campaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes
had proposed.*’ Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia, and
that Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians.®” According
to Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of Russian contacts with
Kushner, advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts, and
told Kushner both that the Campaign should not highlight Russia as an issue and should handle
any contacts with Russians with care.%' Kushner generally provided a similar account of his
interactions with Simes.5% -

Among the Kushner-Simes meetings was one held on August 17, 2016, at Simes’s request,
in Kushner’s New York office. The meeting was to address foreign policy advice that CNI was
providing and how to respond to the Clinton Campaign’s Russia-related attacks on candidate

Trump.®? In advance of the meeting, Simes sent Kushner a “Russia Policy Memo” laying out
“what Mr. Trump may want to say about Russia.”®** In a cover email transmitting that memo and
a phone call to set up the meeting, Simes mentioned “a well-documented story of highly
questionable connections between Bill Clinton” and the Russian government, “parts of [which]”
(according to Simes) had even been “discussed with the CIA and the FBI in the late 1990s and
shared with the [Independent Counsel] at the end of the Clinton presidency.”®* Kushner
forwarded the email to senior Trump Campaign officials Stephen Miller, Paul Manafort, and Rick
Gates, with the note “suggestion only.”%® Manafort subsequently forwarded the email to his
assistant and scheduled a meeting with Simes.®”” (Manafort was on the verge of leaving the
Campaign by the time of the scheduled meeting with Simes, and Simes ended up meeting only
with Kushner).

intelligence sources, not from Russians.

Simes perceived that Kushner did not find the information to be of interest or use to the
Campaign because it was, in Simes’s words, “old news.”®' When interviewed by the Office,
Kushner stated that he believed that there was little chance of something new being revealed about
the Clintons given their long career as public figures, and that he never received from Simes
information that could be “operationalized” for the Trump Campaign.®®* Despite Kushner’s

tend to exaggerate Putin’s flaws.” The memorandum also recommended approaching general Russian-
related questions in the framework of “how to work with Russia to advance important U.S. national
interests” and that a Trump Administration “not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy.” The

5. June 9, 2016 Meeting at Trump Tower

On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with
a Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the
Russian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert
Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer
Aras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia . . . offered
to provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would
incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as “part of Russia and its government’s support
for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. immediately responded that “if it’s what you say I love it,” and arranged
the meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.

Trump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushner to
attend the meeting, and both attended. Members of the Campaign discussed the meeting before it
occurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump Jr. may have told candidate Trump about an
upcoming meeting to receive adverse information about Clinton, without linking the meeting to
Russia. According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of
learning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he
was made aware of the meeting—or its Russian connection—before it occurred.

The Russian attorney who spoke at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had previously
worked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout
this period of time. She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided
to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but
Veselnitskaya did not provide such information. She and her associates then turned to a critique of
the origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on
Russian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr.
suggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected. After the
election, Veselnitskaya made additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump
Transition Team did not engage.

This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but Is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by
Aras and Emin.

What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak fo Emin abaut it directly?

| can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanied to send to you first.

concerning potentially negative information about Hillary Clinton.””"

b. The Events of June 9, 2016
i. Arrangements for the Meeting
Veselnitskaya was in New York on June 9, 2016, for appellate proceedings in the Prevezon
civil forfeiture litigation.”"* That day, Veselnitskaya called Rinat Akhmetshin, a Soviet-born U.S.
obbyis., SRR e s earmed that he was in New York, invied him

13 Written Responses of Donald J. Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 8 (Response to Question I, Parts (a)-
(c)). We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous
knowledge of the June 9 meeting. On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give “a major speech”
“probably Monday of next week”—which would have been June 13—about “all of the things that have
taken place with the Clintons.” See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting,
Washington Post (Aug. 7, 2018). Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changed the subject of his planned
speech to national security. But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was
connected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that
meeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton. Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting
on June 12, could well have caused the change. The President’s written answers to our questions state that
the speech’s focus was altered “[i]n light of” the Pulse nightclub shooting. See Written Responses, supra.
As for the original topic of the June 13 speech, Trump has said that “he expected to give a speech referencing
the publicly available, negative information about the Clintons,” and that the draft of the speech prepared
by Campaign staff “was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the
book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.” Written Responses, supra. In a later June 22 speech, Trump did
speak extensively about allegations that Clinton was corrupt, drawing from the Clinfon Cash book. See

questions about how the alleged payments could be tied specifically to the Clinton Campaign, but

they call him to give him an excuse to leave.””® Samochornov recalled that Kushner departed the
meeting before it concluded; Veselnitskaya recalled the same when interviewed by the press in
July 2017.7%¢ '

Veselnitskaya’s press interviews and written statements to Congress differ materially from
other accounts. In a July 2017 press interview, Veselnitskaya claimed that she has no connection
to the Russian government and had not referred to any derogatory information concerning the
Clinton Campaign when she met with Trump Campaign officials.””’ Veselnitskaya’s November
2017 written submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that the purpose of the June 9
meeting was not to connect with “the Trump Campaign” but rather to have “a private meeting with
Donald Trump Jr.—a friend of my good acquaintance’s son on the matter of assisting me or my
colleagues in informing the Congress members as to the criminal nature of manipulation and
interference with the legislative activities of the US Congress.”™® In other words, Veselnitskaya
claimed her focus was on Congress and not the Campaign. No witness, however, recalled any
reference to Congress during the meeting. Veselnitskaya also maintained that she “attended the
meeting as a lawyer of Denis Katsyv,” the previously mentioned owner of Prevezon Holdings, but
she did not “introduce [her]self in this capacity.””**

In a July 2017 television interview, Trump Jr. stated that while he had no way to gauge the
reliability, credibility, or accuracy of what Goldstone had stated was the purpose of the meeting,
if “someone has information on our opponent . . . maybe this is something. I should hear them
out.”’*0  Trump Jr. further stated in September 2017 congressional testimony that he thought he
should “listen to what Rob and his colleagues had to say.”™ Depending on what, if any,
information was provided, Trump Jr. stated he could then “consult with counsel to make an
informed decision as to whether to give it any further consideration.”*

to Goldstone, around January 2017, Kaveladze contacted him again to set up another meeting, but
Goldstone did not make the request.”>® The investigation did not identify evidence of the transition
team following up.

Participants in the June 9, 2016 meeting began receiving inquiries from attorneys
representing the Trump Organization starting in approximately June 2017. % On approximately
June 2, 2017, Goldstone spoke with Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization,
about his participation in the June 9 meeting.”® The same day, Goldstone emailed Veselnitskaya’s
name to Garten, identifying her as the “woman who was the attorney who spoke at the meeting
from Moscow.””® Later in June 2017, Goldstone participated in a lengthier call with Garten and
Alan Futerfas, outside counsel for the Trump Organization (and, subsequently, personal counsel
for Trump Jr.).”” On June 27, 2017, Goldstone emailed Emin Agalarov with the subject “Trump
attorneys” and stated that he was “interviewed by attorneys™ about the June 9 meeting who were
“concerned because it links Don Jr. to officials from Russia—which he has always denied
meeting.””*® Goldstone stressed that he “did say at the time this was an awful idea and a terrible
meeting.””® Emin Agalarov sent a screenshot of the message to Kaveladze.”

The June 9 meeting became public in July 2017. In a July 9, 2017 text message to Emin

relationship with “mr T has been thrown down the drain.”’®* The next month, Goldstone

commented to Emin Agalarov about the volume of publicity the June 9 meeting had generated,
stating that his “reputation [was] basically destroyed by this dumb meeting which your father
insisted on even though Ike and Me told him would be bad news and not to do.”” Goldstone
added, “I am not able to respond out of courtesy to you and your father. So am painted as some
mysterious link to Putin.”’®

After public reporting on the June 9 meeting began, representatives from the Trump
Organization again reached out to participants. On July 10, 2017, Futerfas sent Goldstone an email
with a proposed statement for Goldstone to issue, which read:

As the person who arranged the meeting, I can definitively state that the statements I have
read by Donald Trump Jr. are 100% accurate. The meeting was a complete waste of time
and Don was never told Ms. Veselnitskaya’s name prior to the meeting. Ms. Veselnitskaya
mostly talked about the Magnitsky Act and Russian adoption laws and the meeting lasted
20 to 30 minutes at most. There was never any follow up and nothing ever came of the
meeting.”®’

the statement drafted by Trump Organization representatives was

758 He proposed a different statement, asserting that he had been

asked “by [his] client in Moscow — Emin Agalarov — to facilitate a meeting between a Russian

attorney (Natalia Veselnitzkaya [sic]) and Donald Trump Jr. The lawyer had apparently stated

that she had some information regarding funding to the DNC from Russia, which she believed Mr.
Trump Jr. might find interesting.”” Goldstone never released either statement.””

On the Russian end, there were also communications about what participants should say
about the June 9 meeting. Specifically, the organization that hired Samochornov—an anti-
Magnitsky Act group controlled by Veselnitskaya and the owner of Prevezon—offered to pay
$90,000 of Samochornov’s legal fees.””! At Veselnitskaya’s request, the organization sent
Samochornov a transcript of a Veselnitskaya press interview, and Samochornov understood that
the organization would pay his legal fees only if he made statements consistent with
Veselnitskaya’s.””?  Samochornov declined, telling the Office that he did not want to petjure

did not expressly condition payment on following Veselnitskaya’s answers but, in hindsight,
recognized that by sending the transcript, Samochornov could have interpreted the offer of
assistance to be conditioned on his not contradicting Veselnitskaya’s account.”’

Volume 11, Section I1.G, infra, discusses interactions between President Trump, Trump Jr.,
and others in June and July 2017 regarding the June 9 meeting.

6. Events at the Republican National Convention

Trump Campaign officials met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the week
of the Republican National Convention. The evidence indicates that those interactions were brief
and non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately before the Convention,
J.D. Gordon, a senior Campaign advisor on policy and national security, diluted a proposed
amendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing “lethal” assistance
to Ukraine in response to Russian aggtession. Gordon requested that platform committee
personnel revise the proposed amendment to state that only “appropriate” assistance be provided
to Ukraine. The original sponsor of the “lethal” assistance amendment stated that Gordon told her
(the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his request to
dilute the language. Gordon denied making that statement to the sponsor, although he
acknowledged it was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the
subject matter. The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the
candidate to make that proposal. Gordon said that he sought the change because he believed the
proposed language was inconsistent with Trump’s position on Ukraine.

a. Ambassador Kislyak’s Encounters with Senator Sessions and J.D. Gordon the
Week of the RNC

In July 2016, Senator Sessions and Gordon spoke at the Global Partners in Diplomacy
event, a conference co-sponsored by the State Department and the Heritage Foundation held in
Cleveland, Ohio the same week as the Republican National Convention (RNC or
“Convention”).””® Approximately 80 foreign ambassadors to the United States, including Kislyak,
were invited to the conference.””

On July 20, 2016, Gordon and Sessions delivered their speeches at the conference.””” In
his speech, Gordon stated in pertinent part that the United States should have better relations with

Russia.””® During Sessions’s speech, he took questions from the audience, one of which may have
been asked by Kislyak.”” - When the speeches concluded, several ambassadors lined up to greet
the speakers.”® Gordon shook hands with Kislyak and reiterated that he had meant what he said
in the speech about improving U.S.-Russia relations.”®! Sessions separately spoke with between
six and 12 ambassadors, including Kislyak.”® Although Sessions stated during interviews with
the Office that he had no specific recollection of what he discussed with Kislyak, he believed that
the two spoke for only a few minutes and that they would have exchanged pleasantries and said
some things about U.S.-Russia relations.”

Later that evening, Gordon attended a reception as part of the conference.”®* Gordon ran
into Kislyak as the two prepared plates of food, and they decided to sit at the same table to eat.”™
They were joined at that table by the ambassadors from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and by Trump
Campaign advisor Carter Page.”®® As they ate, Gordon and Kislyak talked for what Gordon
estimated to have been three to five minutes, during which Gordon again mentioned that he meant
what he said in his speech about improving U.S.-Russia relations.”’

b. Change to Republican Party Platform

In preparation for the 2016 Convention, foreign policy advisors to the Trump Campaign,
working with the Republican National Committee, reviewed the 2012 Convention’s foreign policy
platform to identify divergence between the earlier platform and candidate Trump’s positions.”®
The Campaign team discussed toning down language from the 2012 platform that identified Russia
as the country’s number one threat, given the candidate’s belief that there needed to be better U.S.
relations with Russia.”®® The RNC Platform Committee sent the 2016 draft platform to the

Although only delegates could participate in formal discussions and vote on the platform,
the Trump Campaign could request changes, and members of the Trump Campaign attended
committee meetings.”! John Mashburn, the Campaign’s policy director, helped oversee the
Campaign’s involvement in the platform committee meetings.””> He told the Office that he
directed Campaign staff at the Convention, including J.D. Gordon, to take a hands-off approach
and only to challenge platform planks if they directly contradicted Trump’s wishes.™?

On July 11, 2016, delegate Diana Denman submitted a proposed platform amendment that
included provision of armed support for Ukraine.””* The amendment described Russia’s “ongoing
military aggression” in Ukraine and announced “support” for “maintaining (and, if warranted,
increasing) sanctions against Russia until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully
restored” and for “providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine’s armed forces and greater
coordination with NATO on defense planning.”™® Gordon reviewed the proposed platform
changes, including Denman’s.”® Gordon stated that he flagged this amendment because of
Trump’s stated position on Ukraine, which Gordon personally heard the candidate say at the March
31 foreign policy meeting—namely, that the Europeans should take primary responsibility for any
assistance to Ukraine, that there should be improved U.S.-Russia relations, and that he did not
want to start World War IIT over that region.”” Gordon told the Office that Trump’s statements
on the campaign trail following the March meeting underscored those positions to the point where
Gordon felt obliged to object to the proposed platform change and seck its dilution.”®

language contradicted Trump’s views and relied on Gordon’s recollection of the candidate’s

had to clear the language and that Gordon was “talking to New York.”*” Denman told others that
she was asked by the two Trump Campaign staffers to strike “lethal defense weapons” from the
proposal but that she refused.*®* Denman recalled Gordon saying that he was on the phone with

platform amendment. 5%

Gordon stated that he tried to reach Rick Dearborn, a senior foreign policy advisor, and
Mashburn, the Campaign policy director. Gordon stated that he connected with both of them (he
could not recall if by phone or in person) and apprised them of the language he took issue with in
the proposed amendment. Gordon recalled no objection by either Dearborn or Mashburn and that
all three Campaign advisors supported the alternative formulation (“appropriate assistance”).*”
Dearborn recalled Gordon warning them about the amendment, but not weighing in because
Gordon was more familiar with the Campaign’s foreign policy stance.!” Mashburn stated that
Gordon reached him, and he told Gordon that Trump had not taken a stance on the issue and that
the Campaign should not intervene.!!

7. Post-Convention Contacts with Kislyak

Ambassador Kislyak continued his efforts to interact with Campaign officials with
responsibility for the foreign-policy portfolio—among them Sessions and Gordon—in the weeks
after the Convention. The Office did not identify evidence in those interactions of coordination
between the Campaign and the Russian government.

a. Ambassador Kislyak Invites J.D. Gordon to Breakfast at the Ambassador’s
Residence

On August 3, 2016, an official from the Embassy of the Russian Federation in the United
States wrote to Gordon “[o]n behalf of” Ambassador Kislyak inviting Gordon “to have
breakfast/tea with the Ambassador at his residence” in Washington, D.C. the following week.31®
Gordon responded five days later to decline the invitation. He wrote, “[t]hese days are not optimal
for us, as we are busily knocking down a constant stream of false media stories while also preparing
for the first debate with HRC. Hope to take a raincheck for another time when things quiet down
a bit. Please pass along my regards to the Ambassador.”®"” The investigation did not identify
evidence that Gordon made any other arrangements to meet (or met) with Kislyak after this email.

b. Senator Sessions’s September 2016 Meeting with Ambassador Kislyak

office about setting up a meeting with Kislyak.**® At the time, Sessions was a member of the

Senate Foreign Relations Committee and would meet with foreign officials in that capacity.**! But
Sessions’s staff reported, and Sessions himself acknowledged, that meeting requests from
ambassadors increased substantially in 2016, as Sessions assumed a prominent role in the Trump
Campaign and his name was mentioned for potential cabinet-level positions in a future
Trump Administration.???

On September 8, 2016, Sessions met with Kislyak in his Senate office.*** Sessions said
that he believed he was doing the Campaign a service by meeting with foreign ambassadors,
including Kislyak.*?* He was accompanied in the meeting by at least two of his Senate staff:
Sandra Luff, his legislative director; and Pete Landrum, who handled military affairs.*® The
meeting lasted less than 30 minutes.®?® Sessions voiced concerns about Russia’s sale of a missile-
defense system to Iran, Russian planes buzzing U.S. military assets in the Middle East, and Russian
aggression in emerging democracies such as Ukraine and Moldova.®®’ Kislyak offered
explanations on these issues and complained about NATO land forces in former Soviet-bloc
countries that border Russia.®??® Landrum recalled that Kislyak referred to the presidential
campaign as “an interesting campaign,”® and Sessions also recalled Kislyak saying that the
Russian government was receptive to the overtures Trump had laid out during his campaign.**
None of the attendees, though, remembered any discussion of Russian election interference or any
request that Sessions convey information from the Russian government to the Trump Campaign.®*!

During the meeting, Kislyak invited Sessions to further discuss U.S.-Russia relations with
him over a meal at the ambassador’s residence.®*? Sessions was non-committal when Kislyak
extended the invitation. After the meeting ended, Luff advised Sessions against accepting the one-
on-one meeting with Kislyak, whom she assessed to be an “old school KGB guy.”®** Neither Luff
nor Landrum recalled that Sessions followed up on the invitation or made any further effort to dine

investigation did not identify evidence that the two men met at any point after their September 8
meeting.

8. Paul Manafort

Paul Manafort served on the Trump Campaign, including a period as campaign chairman,
from March to August 2016.33%  Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for
Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine.
Manafort stayed in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin
Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort’s office in Kiev and who
the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence.

Manafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign and a longtime employee,*
to provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign—including internal polling data,
although Manafort claims not to recall that specific instruction. Manafort expected Kilimnik to
share that information with others in Ukraine and with Deripaska. Gates periodically sent such
polling data to Kilimnik during the campaign.

8% On August 21, 2018, Manafort was convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia on eight tax,
Foreign Bank Account Registration (FBAR), and bank fraud charges. On September 14, 2018, Manafort
pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to
commit offenses against the United States (money laundering, tax fraud, FBAR, Foreign Agents
Registration Act (FARA), and FARA false statements), and (2) conspiracy to obstruct justice (witness
tampering). Manafort also admitted criminal conduct with which he had been charged in the Eastern
District of Virginia, but as to which the jury hung. The conduct at issue in both cases involved Manafort’s
work in Ukraine and the money he earned for that work, as well as crimes after the Ukraine work ended.
On March 7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months of imprisonment in the Virginia prosecution. On
March 13, the district court in D.C. sentenced Manafort to a total term of 73 months: 60 months on the
Count 1 conspiracy (with 30 of those months to run concurrent to the Virginia sentence), and 13 months on
the Count 1 conspiracy, to be served consecutive to the other two sentences. The two sentences resulted in
a total term of 90 months.

839 As noted in Volume I, Section IT1.D. 1.b, supra, Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in
the District of Columbia, including making a false statement to the FBI, pursuant to a plea agreement. He
has provided information and in-court testimony that the Office has deemed to be reliable. See also

Manafort also twice met Kilimnik in the United States during the campaign period and
conveyed campaign information. The second meeting took place on August 2, 2016, in New York
City. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a message from former Ukrainian
President Viktor Yanukovych, who was then living in Russia. The message was about a peace
plan for Ukraine that Manafort has since acknowledged was a “backdoor” means for Russia to
control eastern Ukraine. Several months later, after the presidential election, Kilimnik wrote an
email to Manafort expressing the view—which Manafort later said he shared—that the plan’s
success would require U.S. support to succeed: “all that is required to start the process is a very
minor ‘wink’ (or slight push) from [Donald Trump].”®**® The email also stated that if Manafort
were designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his
reception in Russia “at the very top level.”

Manafort communicated with Kilimnik about peace plans for Ukraine on at least four
occasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2: December 2016 (the Kilimnik email
described above); January 2017; February 2017; and again in the spring of 2018. The Office
reviewed numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about
the plan in written questions.®! The investigation did not uncover evidence of Manafort’s passing
along information about Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or
the Administration. The Office was not, however, able to gain access to all of Manafort’s
electronic communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications).
And while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new
Administration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan
and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was among the reasons that
the district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement.®**

The Office could not reliably determine Manafort’s purpose in sharing internal polling data
with Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort “did not see

a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would

to him any particular positions that Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to support. Written
Responses of Donald J. Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 16-17 (Response to Question IV, Part (d)).

842 Manafort made several false statements during debriefings. Based on that conduct, the Office
determined that Manafort had breached his plea agreement and could not be a cooperating witness. The
judge presiding in Manafort’s D.C. criminal case found by a preponderance of the evidence that Manafort
intentionally made multiple false statements to the FBI, the Office, and the grand jury concerning his
interactions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues). Although the report
refers at times to Manafort’s statements, it does so only when those statements are sufficiently corroborated
to be trustworthy, to identify issues on which Manafort’s untruthful responses may themselves be of
evidentiary value, or to provide Manafort’s explanations for certain events, even when we were unable to
determine whether that explanation was credible.

be “good for business” and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed
in the Ukraine. As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with
him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a “disagreement”—a reference to
one or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort’s credibility and our
limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik,
the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The
Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort’s sharing polling data and
Russia’s interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the
time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise
coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.

a. Paul Manafort’s Ties to Russia and Ukraine

Manafort’s Russian contacts during the campaign and transition periods stem from his
consulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate political
consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company DMP International
LLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this entire period and continued to
communicate with Manafort through at least June 2018. Kilimnik, who speaks and writes
Ukrainian and Russian, facilitated many of Manafort’s communications with Deripaska and
Ukrainian oligarchs.

i.  Oleg Deripaska Consulting Work

In approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who
has a global empire involving aluminum and power companies and who is closely aligned with
Vladimir Putin.®?® A memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for Deripaska in
2005 regarding the post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin and the benefits
that the work could confer on “the Putin Government.”®** Gates described the work Manafort did
for Deripaska as “political risk insurance,” and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install
friendly political officials in countries where Detipaska had business interests.** Manafort’s
company earned tens of millions of dollars from its work for Deripaska and was loaned millions
of dollars by Deripaska as well

In 2007, Deripaska invested through another entity in Pericles Emerging Market Partners
L.P. (“Pericles”), an investment fund created by Manafort and former Manafort business partner
Richard Davis. The Pericles fund was established to pursue investments in Eastern Europe.®’
Deripaska was the sole investor.3*® Gates stated in interviews with the Office that the venture led

to a deterioration of the relationship between Manafort and Deripaska.’*’ In particular, when the
fund failed, litigation between Manafort and Deripaska ensued. Gates stated that, by 2009,
Manafort’s business relationship with Deripaska had “dried up.”®*® According to Gates, various
interactions with Deripaska and his intermediaries over the past few years have involved trying to
resolve the legal dispute.’>' As described below, in 2016, Manafort, Gates, Kilimnik, and others
engaged in efforts to revive the Deripaska relationship and resolve the litigation.

ii.  Political Consulting Work

Through Deripaska, Manafort was introduced to Rinat Akhmetov, a Ukrainian oligarch
who hired Manafort as a political consultant.®> In 2005, Akhmetov hired Manafort to engage in
political work supporting the Party of Regions,®* a political party in Ukraine that was generally
understood to align with Russia. Manafort assisted the Party of Regions in regaining power, and
its candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, won the presidency in 2010. Manafort became a close and
trusted political advisor to Yanukovych during his time as President of Ukraine. Yanukovych
served in that role until 2014, when he fled to Russia amidst popular protests.®**

iti.  Konstantin Kilimnik

Kilimnik is a Russian national who has lived in both Russia and Ukraine and was a
longtime Manafort employee.?”® Kilimnik had direct and close access to Yanukovych and his
senior entourage, and he facilitated communications between Manafort and his clients, including
Yanukovych and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs.®*® Kilimnik also maintained a relationship with
Deripaska’s deputy, Viktor Boyarkin,**’ a Russian national who previously setved in the defense
attaché office of the Russian Embassy to the United States.**

Manafort told the Office that he did not believe Kilimnik was working as a Russian
“spy.”®® The FBI, however, assesses that Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence.*® Several
pieces of the Office’s evidence—including witness interviews and emails obtained through court-

i. Paul Manafort Joins the Campaign

Manafort served on the Trump Campaign from late March to August 19, 2016. On March
29, 2016, the Campaign announced that Manafort would serve as the Campaign’s “Convention
Manager.”®”!  On May 19, 2016, Manafort was promoted to campaign chairman and chief
strategist, and Gates, who had been assisting Manafort on the Campaign, was appointed deputy
campaign chairman.®”?

Thomas Barrack and Roger Stone both recommended Manafort to candidate Trump.t” In
early 2016, at Manafort’s request, Barrack suggested to Trump that Manafort join the Campaign
to manage the Republican Convention.®”* Stone had worked with Manafort from approximately
1980 until the mid-1990s through various consulting and lobbying firms. Manafort met Trump in
1982 when Trump hired the Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly lobbying firm.*”> Over the years,
Manafort saw Trump at political and social events in New York City and at Stone’s wedding, and
Trump requested VIP status at the 1988 and 1996 Republican conventions worked by Manafort.*’®

According to Gates, in March 2016, Manafort traveled to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in
Florida to meet with Trump. Trump hired him at that time.}”” Manafort agreed to work on the
Campaign without pay. Manafort had no meaningful income at this point in time, but resuscitating
his domestic political campaign career could be financially beneficial in the future. Gates reported
that Manafort intended, if Trump won the Presidency, to remain outside the Administration and
monetize his relationship with the Administration.®”®

ii. Paul Manafort’s Campaign-Period Contacts

Immediately upon joining the Campaign, Manafort directed Gates to prepare for his review
separate memoranda addressed to Deripaska, Akhmetov, Serhiy Lyovochkin, and Boris
Kolesnikov,*”” the last three being Ukrainian oligarchs who were senior Opposition Bloc
officials.*® The memoranda described Manafort’s appointment to the Trump Campaign and
indicated his willingness to consult on Ukrainian politics in the future. On March 30, 2016, Gates
emailed the memoranda and a press release announcing Manafort’s appointment to Kilimnik for
translation and dissemination.®®! Manafort later followed up with Kilimnik to ensure his messages
had been delivered, emailing on April 11, 2016 to ask whether Kilimnik had shown “our friends”
the media coverage of his new role.¥® Kilimnik replied, “Absolutely. Every article.” Manafort
further asked: “How do we use to get whole. Has Ovd [Oleg Vladimirovich Deripaska] operation
seen?” Kilimnik wrote back the same day, “Yes, I have been sending everything to Victor
[Boyarkin, Deripaska’s deputy], who has been forwarding the coverage directly to QV[.”8%

Gates reported that Manafort said that being hired on the Campaign would be “good for
business” and increase the likelihood that Manafort would be paid the approximately $2 million
he was owed for previous political consulting work in Ukraine.?® Gates also explained to the
Office that Manafort thought his role on the Campaign could help “confirm” that Deripaska had
dropped the Pericles lawsuit, and that Gates believed Manafort sent polling data to Deripaska (as

discussed further below) so that Deripaska would not move forward with his lawsuit against
Manafort.8¥ Gates further stated that Deripaska wanted a visa to the United States, that Deripaska
could believe that having Manafort in a position inside the Campaign or Administration might be
helpful to Deripaska, and that Manafort’s relationship with Trump could help Deripaska in other
ways as well.*®¢ Gates stated, however, that Manafort never told him anything specific about what,
if anything, Manafort might be offering Deripaska.®’

Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send
Kilimnik Campaign internal polling data and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share
it with Ukrainian oligarchs.®®® Gates understood that the information would also be shared with
Deripaska 389 Gates reported to the Office
that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it
was a way to showcase Manafort’s work, and Manafort wanted to open doors to jobs after the
Trump Campaign ended.®” Gates said that Manafort’s instruction included sending internal
polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio.*! Fabrizio had worked
with Manafort for years and was brought into the Campaign by Manafort. Gates stated that, in
accordance with Manafort’s instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp;
Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis.**? Gates further told the Office that, after
Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and
that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data.®?

  
  

Gates’s account about polling data is consistent
with multiple emails that
Kilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016.
Those emails referenced “internal polling,” described the status of the Trump Campaign and

Manafort’s role in it, and assessed Trump’s prospects for victory.*” Manafort did not

acknowledge instructing Gates to send Kilimnik internal data,

The Office also obtained contemporaneous emails that shed light on the purpose of the
communications with Deripaska and that are consistent with Gates’s account. For example, in
response to a July 7, 2016, email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort’s failed Deripaska-
backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on “this issue
with our friend.”®®” Gates stated that “our friend” likely referred to Deripaska,*”® and Manafort
told the Office that the “issue” (and “our biggest interest,” as stated below) was a solution to the
Deripaska-Pericles issue.!”” Kilimnik replied:

I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest.

Our friend [Boyarkin] said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in
his boss’ [Deripaska’s] mind, and he will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to
you preity soon, understanding all the time sensitivity. I am more than sure that it will be
resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V.’s boss [Deripaska].”®

Eight minutes later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin’s “boss,” a reference to
Deripaska, “that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate.”®" Manafort has alleged to
the Office that he was willing to brief Deripaska only on public campaign matters and gave an
example: why Trump selected Mike Pence as the Vice-Presidential running mate.”" Manafort
said he never gave Deripaska a briefing.””® Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would
want to use Manafort to advance whatever interests Deripaska had in the United States and
elsewhere.”%*

iii. Paul Manafort’s Two Campaign-Period Meetings with Konstantin Kilimnik
in the United States

Manafort twice met with Kilimnik in person during the campaign period—once in May
and again in August 2016. The first meeting took place on May 7, 2016, in New York City.”” In
the days leading to the meeting, Kilimnik had been working to gather information about the
political situation in Ukraine. That included information gleaned from a trip that former Party of
Regions official Yuriy Boyko had recently taken to Moscow—a trip that likely included meetings
between Boyko and high-ranking Russian officials.*® Kilimnik then traveled to Washington, D.C.
on or about May 3, 2016; while in Washington, Kilimnik had pre-arranged meetings with State
Department employees.”"’

Late on the evening of May 6, Gates arranged for Kilimnik to take a 3:00 a.m. train to meet
Manafort in New York for breakfast on May 7.°%® According to Manafort, during the meeting, he
and Kilimnik talked about events in Ukraine, and Manafort briefed Kilimnik on the Trump
Campaign, expecting Kilimnik to pass the information back to individuals in Ukraine and
elsewhere.’® Manafort stated that Opposition Bloc members recognized Manafort’s position on
the Campaign was an opportunity, but Kilimnik did not ask for anything.”'® Kilimnik spoke about
a plan of Boyko to boost election participation in the eastern zone of Ukraine, which was the base
for the Opposition Bloc.”!! Kilimnik returned to Washington, D.C. right after the meeting with
Manafort.

Manafort met with Kilimnik a second time at the Grand Havana Club in New York City
on the evening of August 2, 2016. The events leading to the meeting are as follows. On July 28,
2016, Kilimnik flew from Kiev to Moscow.”'? The next day, Kilimnik wrote to Manafort
requesting that they meet, using coded language about a conversation he had that day.’”® In an
email with a subject line “Black Caviar,” Kilimnik wrote:

I met today with the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago. We
spent about 5 hours talking about his story, and I have several important messages from
him to you. He asked me to go and brief you on our conversation. I said I have to run it

country, and is quite interesting,”!*

Manafort identified “the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar” as Yanukovych. He
explained that, in 2010, he and Yanukovych had lunch to celebrate the recent presidential election.
Yanukovych gave Manafort a large jar of black caviar that was worth approximately $30,000 to
$40,000.°'5 Manafort’s identification of Yanukovych as “the guy who gave you your biggest black
caviar jar” is consistent with Kilimnik being in Moscow—where Yanukovych resided—when
Kilimnik wrote “I met today with the guy,” and with a December 2016 email in which Kilimnik
referred to Yanukovych as “BG,” 916 Manafort replied to Kilimnik’s July 29
email, “Tuesday [August 2] is best . . . Tues or weds in NYC.”?!7

Three days later, on July 31, 2016, Kilimnik flew back to Kiev from Moscow, and on that
same day, wrote to Manafort that he needed “about 2 hours” for their meeting “because it is a long
caviar story to tell.”®'® Kilimnik wrote that he would arrive at JFK on August 2 at 7:30 p.m., and
he and Manafort agreed to a late dinner that night.”!” Documentary evidence—including flight,
phone, and hotel records, and the timing of text messages exchanged”*"—confirms the dinner took
place as planned on August 2.7*!

As to the contents of the meeting itself, the accounts of Manafort and Gates—who arrived
late to the dinner—differ in certain respects. But their versions of events, when assessed alongside
available documentary evidence and what Kilimnik told business associate Sam Patten, indicate
that at least three principal topics were discussed.

First, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a plan to resolve the ongoing political problems in
Ukraine by creating an autonomous republic in its more industrialized eastern region of Donbas,”*

that Kilimnik flew on a commercial flight to New York.

%2 The Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, which are located in the Donbas region of
Ukraine, declared themselves independent in response to the popular unrest in 2014 that removed President
Yanukovych from power. Pro-Russian Ukrainian militia forces, with backing from the Russian military,
have occupied the region since 2014. Under the Yanukovych-backed plan, Russia would assist in
withdrawing the military, and Donbas would become an autonomous region within Ukraine with its own

and having Yanukovych, the Ukrainian President ousted in 2014, elected to head that republic.”?’
That plan, Manafort later acknowledged, constituted a “backdoor” means for Russia to control
eastern Ukraine.”?* Manafort initially said that, if he had not cut off the discussion, Kilimnik would
have asked Manafort in the August 2 meeting to convince Trump to come out in favor of the peace
plan, and Yanukovych would have expected Manafort to use his connections in Europe and
Ukraine to support the plan.””> Manafort also initially told the Office that he had said to Kilimnik
that the plan was crazy, that the discussion ended, and that he did not recall Kilimnik askin
Manafort to reconsider the plan after their August 2 meeting.”?® Manafort said

    
 
 

 
   

 

that he reacted negatively to Yanukovych sending—years later—an “urgent”
request when Yanukovych needed him.”*” When confronted with an email written by Kilimnik on

again in that email.””® Manafort ultimately acknowledged Kilimnik also raised the peace plan in
J anuari and February 2017 meetings with Manafortﬂ

Second, Manafort briefed Kilimnik on the state of the Trump Campaign and Manafort’s
plan to win the election,”®® That briefing encompassed the Campaign’s messaging and its internal
polling data. According to Gates, it also included discussion of “battleground” states, which
Manafort identified as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.”*’ Manafort did not
refer explicitly to “battleground” states in his telling of the August 2 discussion,

   

 

prime minister. The plan emphasized that Yanukovych would be an ideal candidate to bring peace to the

region as prime minister of the republic, and facilitate the reintegration of the region into Ukraine with the

support of the U.S. and Russian presidents. As noted above, according to _ the written

documentation describing the plan, for the plan to work, both U.S. and Russian support were necessary.

Third, according to Gates and what Kilimnik told Patten, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed
two sets of financial disputes related to Manafort’s previous work in the region. Those consisted
of the unresolved Deripaska lawsuit and the funds that the Opposition Bloc owed to Manafort for
his political consulting work and how Manafort might be able to obtain payment.**®

After the meeting, Gates and Manafort both stated that they left separately from Kilimnik
because they knew the media was tracking Manafort and wanted to avoid media reporting on his
connections to Kilimnik.”*

c. Post-Resignation Activities

Manafort resigned from the Trump Campaign in mid-August 2016, approximately two
weeks after his second meeting with Kilimnik, amidst negative media reporting about his political
consulting work for the pro-Russian Party of Regions in Ukraine. Despite his resignation,
Manafort continued to offer advice to various Campaign officials through the November election.
Manafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump,” and some
of those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails. For example, on October 21, 2016,
Manafort sent Kushner an email and attached a strategy memorandum proposing that the
Campaign make the case against Clinton “as the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment”
and that “Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very credible
way — by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC members.””*® Later, in a
November 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled “Securing the Victory,” Manafort stated that he was
“really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory,” and
that he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respond to a loss by “mov[ing] immediately
to discredit the [Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that
the Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the results.”**’

Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Manafort told the Office that, in the
wake of Trump’s victory, he was not interested in an Administration job. Manafort instead
preferred to stay on the “outside,” and monetize his campaign position to generate business given
his familiarity and relationship with Trump and the incoming Administration.”® Manafort
appeared to follow that plan, as he traveled to the Middle East, Cuba, South Korea, Japan, and
China and was paid to explain what a Trump presidency would entail.”*

Manafort’s activities in early 2017 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia. The

first meeting, which took place in Madrid, Spain in January 2017, was with Georgiy Oganov.
Oganov, who had previously worked at the Russian Embassy in the United States, was a senior
executive at a Deripaska company and was believed to report directly to Deripaska.”*® Manafort
initially denied attending the meeting. When he later acknowledged it, he claimed that the meeting
had been arranged by his lawyers and concerned only the Pericles lawsuit.’*! Other evidence,
however, provides reason to doubt Manafort’s statement that the sole topic of the meeting was the
Pericles lawsuit. In particular, text messages to Manafort from a number associated with Kilimnik
suggest that Kilimnik and Boyarkin—not Manafort’s counsel—had arranged the meeting between
Manafort and Oganov.’? Kilimnik’s message states that the meeting was supposed to be “not
about money or Pericles” but instead “about recreating [the] old friendship”—ostensibly between
Manafort and Deripaska—-“and talking about global politics.”* Manafort also replied by text that
he “need[s] this finished before Jan. 20,”°* which appears to be a reference to resolving Pericles
before the inauguration.

On January 15, 2017, three days after his return from Madrid, Manafort emailed K.T.
McFarland, who was at that time designated to be Deputy National Security Advisor and was
formally appointed to that position on January 20, 2017.** Manafort’s January 15 email to
McFarland stated: “T have some important information I want to share that I picked up on my
travels over the last month.”**® Manafort told the Office that the email referred to an issue
regarding Cuba, not Russia or Ukraine, and Manafort had traveled to Cuba in the past month.”’
Either way, McFarland—who was advised by Flynn not to respond to the Manafort inquiry—
appears not to have responded to Manafort.”*3

Manafort told the Office that around the time of the Presidential Inauguration in January,
he met with Kilimnik and Ukrainian oligarch Serhiy Lyovochkin at the Westin Hotel in
Alexandria, Virginia.**® During this meeting, Kilimnik again discussed the Yanukovych peace
plan that he had broached at the August 2 meeting and in a detailed December 8, 2016 message
found in Kilimnik’s DMP email account.”®® In that December 8 email, which Manafort

acknowledged having read,”! Kilimnik wrote, “[a]ll that is required to start the process is a very
minor ‘wink’ (or slight push) from DT”—an apparent reference to President-elect Trump—*“and
a decision to authorize you to be a ‘special representative’ and manage this process.” Kilimnik
assured Manafort, with that authority, he “could start the process and within 10 days visit Russia
[Yanukovych] guarantees your reception at the very top level,” and that “DT could have peace in
Ukraine basically within a few months after inauguration.””?

As noted above, — and statements to the Office, Manafort sought to
ualify his engagement on and support for the plan.

 

On February 26, 2017, Manafort met Kilimnik in Madrid, where Kilimnik had flown from
Moscow.”® In his first two interviews with the Office, Manafort denied meeting with Kilimnik
on his Madrid trip and then—after being confronted with documentary evidence that Kilimnik was
in Madrid at the same time as him—recognized that he met him in Madrid. Manafort said that
Kilimnik had updated him on a criminal investigation into so-called “black ledger” payments to
Manafort that was being conducted by Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau.”’

 

   

Manafort remained in contact with Kilimnik throughout 2017 and into the spring of 2018.

Those contacts included matters pertaining to the criminal charges brought by the Office,”” and
the Ukraine peace plan. In early 2018, Manafort retained his longtime polling firm to craft a draft
poll in Ukraine, sent the pollsters a three-page primer on the plan sent by Kilimnik, and worked
with Kilimnik to formulate the polling questions.”®® The primer sent to the pollsters specifically
called for the United States and President Trump to support the Autonomous Republic of Donbas
with Yanukovych as Prime Minister,’®! and a series of questions in the draft poll asked for opinions
on Yanukovych’s role in resolving the conflict in Donbas.”®* (The poll was not solely about
Donbas; it also sought participants’ views on leaders apart from Yanukovych as they pertained to
the 2019 Ukraine presidential election.)

The Office has not uncovered evidence that Manafort brought the Ukraine peace plan to
the attention of the Trump Campaign or the Trump Administration. Kilimnik continued his efforts
to promote the peace plan to the Executive Branch (e.g., U.S. Department of State) into the summer
of 2018.79

B. Post-Election and Transition-Period Contacts

Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Beginning immediately after the
election, individuals connected to the Russian government started contacting officials on the
Trump Campaign and Transition Team through multiple channels—sometimes through Russian
Ambassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who sought reliable contacts through
U.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team. The most senior levels of the
Russian government encouraged these efforts. The investigation did not establish that these efforts
reflected or constituted coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its election-
interference activities.

1. Immediate Post-Election Activity

As soon as news broke that Trump had been elected President, Russian government
officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new
Administration. They appeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with
senior officials around the President-Elect. As explained below, those efforts entailed both official
contact through the Russian Embassy in the United States and outreaches—sanctioned at high
levels of the Russian government—through business rather than political contacts.

a. Outreach from the Russian Government

At approximately 3 a.m. on election night, Trump Campaign press secretary Hope Hicks
received a telephone call on her personal cell phone from a person who sounded foreign but was
calling from a number with a DC area code.”® Although Hicks had a hard time understanding the
person, she could make out the words “Putin call.”** Hicks told the caller to send her an email.”*

The following morning, on November 9, 2016, Sergey Kuznetsov, an official at the Russian
Embassy to the United States, emailed Hicks from his Gmail address with the subject line,
“Message from Putin.”®” Attached to the email was a message from Putin, in both English and
Russian, which Kuznetsov asked Hicks to convey to the President-Elect.”®® In the message, Putin
offered his congratulations to Trump for his electoral victory, stating he “look[ed] forward to
working with [Trump] on leading Russian-American relations out of crisis.”**

Hicks forwarded the email to Kushner, asking, “Can you look into this? Don’t want to get
duped but don’t want to blow off Putin!”®”® Kushner stated in Congressional testimony that he
believed that it would be possible to verify the authenticity of the forwarded email through the
Russian Ambassador, whom Kushner had previously met in April 2016.°7! Unable to recall the
Russian Ambassador’s name, Kushner emailed Dimitri Simes of CNI, whom he had consulted
previously about Russia, see Volume I, Section IV.A.4, supra, and asked, “What is the name of
Russian ambassador?”®” Kushner forwarded Simes’s response—which identified Kislyak by
name—to Hicks.”” After checking with Kushner to see what he had learned, Hicks conveyed
Putin’s letter to transition officials.”™ Five days later, on November 14, 2016, Trump and Putin
spoke by phone in the presence of Transition Team members, including incoming National
Security Advisor Michael Flynn.””

b. High-Level Encouragement of Contacts through Alternative Channels

As Russian officials in the United States reached out to the President-Elect and his team, a
number of Russian individuals working in the private sector began their own efforts to make
contact. Petr Aven, a Russian national who heads Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest commercial bank,
described to the Office interactions with Putin during this time period that might account for the
flurry of Russian activity.””®

Aven told the Office that he is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who
regularly meet with Putin in the Kremlin; these 50 men are often referred to as “oligarchs.””’
Aven told the Office that he met on a quarterly basis with Putin, including in the fourth quarter
(Q4) of 2016, shortly after the U.S. presidential election.”’® Aven said that he took these meetings
seriously and understood that any suggestions or critiques that Putin made during these meetings
were implicit directives, and that there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow
through.”® As was typical, the 2016 Q4 meeting with Putin was preceded by a preparatory meeting
with Putin’s chief of staff, Anton Vaino.”®

According to Aven, at his Q4 2016 one-on-one meeting with Putin,”®' Putin raised the
prospect that the United States would impose additional sanctions on Russian interests, including
sanctions against Aven and/or Alfa-Bank.”®? Putin suggested that Aven needed to take steps to
protect himself and Alfa-Bank.”® Aven also testified that Putin spoke of the difficulty faced by
the Russian government in getting in touch with the incoming Trump Administration.”®
According to Aven, Putin indicated that he did not know with whom formally to speak and
generally did not know the people around the President-Elect.?®

71 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 7.

979 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 2-3.

Aven referred to the high-ranking Russian government officials using numbers (e.g., Official 1, Official 2).
Aven separately confirmed through an attorney proffer that Official 1 was Putin and Official 2 was Putin’s
chief of staff, Vaino. See Affidavit of Ryan Junck (Aug. 2, 2018) (hard copy on file).

81 At the time of his Q4 2016 meeting with Putin, Aven was generally aware of the press coverage
about Russian interference in the U.S. election. According to Aven, he did not discuss that topic with Putin
at any point, and Putin did not mention the rationale behind the threat of new sanctions. Aven 8/2/18 302,

Aven_ told Putin he would take steps to protect himself and the Alfa-Bank
shareholders from potential sanctions, and one of those steps would be to try to reach out to the
incoming Administration to establish a line of communication.”® Aven described Putin
responding with skepticism about Aven’s prospect for success.”®” According to Aven, although
Putin did not expressly direct him to reach out to the Trump Transition Team, Aven understood
that Putin expected him to try to respond to the concerns he had raised.”® Aven’s efforts are
described in Volume I, Section IV.B.5, infra.

2. Kirill Dmitriev’s Transition-Era Quireach to the Incoming Administration

Aven’s description of his interactions with Putin is consistent with the behavior of Kirill
Dmitriev, a Russian national who heads Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and is closely connected
to Putin. Dmitriev undertook efforts to meet members of the incoming Trump Administration in
the months after the election. Dmitriev asked a close business associate who worked for the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) royal court, George Nader, to introduce him to Trump transition officials,
and Nader eventually arranged a meeting in the Seychelles between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a
Trump Campaign supporter and an associate of Steve Bannon.” In addition, the UAE national
security advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund manager and friend of Jared Kushner, Rick
Gerson, in late November 2016. In December 2016 and January 2017, Dmitriev and Gerson
worked on a proposal for reconciliation between the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev
implied he cleared through Putin. Gerson provided that proposal to Kushner before the
inauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

a. Background

Dmitriev is a Russian national who was appointed CEO of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund,
the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), when it was founded in 2011.°*® Dmitriev reported
directly to Putin and frequently referred to Putin as his “boss.”®"!

RDIF has co-invested in various projects with UAE sovereign wealth funds.®”> Dmitriev
regularly interacted with Nader, a senior advisor to UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed

After the brief second meeting concluded, Nader and Dmitriev discussed what had
transpired.'””® Dmitriev told Nader that he was disappointed in his meetings with Prince for two
reasons: first, he believed the Russians needed to be communicating with someone who had more
authority within the incoming Administration than Prince had.'”” Second, he had hoped to have
a discussion of greater substance, such as outlining a strategic roadmap for both countries to

follow.1%8% Dmitriev told Nader that Prince’s comments

Hours after the second meeting, Prince sent two text messages to Bannon from the
Seychelles.'®®? As described further below, investigators were unable to obtain the content of these
or other messages between Prince and Bannon, and the investigation also did not identify evidence
of any further communication between Prince and Dmitriev after their meetings in the Seychelles.

iii. Erik Prince’s Meeting with Steve Bannon afier the Seychelles Trip

After the Seychelles meetings, Prince told Nader that he would inform Bannon about his
discussion with Dmitriev and would convey that someone within the Russian power structure was
interested in seeking better relations with the incoming Administration.'”® On January 12, 2017,
Prince contacted Bannon’s personal assistant to set up a meeting for the following week.'"

Prince said that he met Bannon at Bannon’s home after returning to the United States in
mid-January and briefed him about several topics, including his meeting with Dmitriev.'®*® Prince
told the Office that he explained to Bannon that Dmitriev was the head of a Russian sovereign
wealth fund and was interested in improving relations between the United States and Russia.!?

uninterested. %!

Bannon, by contrast, told the Office that he never discussed with Prince anything regarding
Dmitriev, RDIF, or any meetings with Russian individuals or people associated with Putin.'%%?
Bannon also stated that had Prince mentioned such a meeting, Bannon would have remembered it,
and Bannon would have objected to such a meeting having taken place.'

The conflicting accounts provided by Bannon and Prince could not be independently
clarified by reviewing their communications, because neither one was able to produce any of the
messages they exchanged in the time period surrounding the Seychelles meeting. Prince’s phone
contained no text messages prior to March 2017, though provider records indicate that he and
Bannon exchanged dozens of messages.!%* Prince denied deleting any messages but claimed he
did not know why there were no messages on his device before March 2017.1°° Bannon’s devices
similarly contained no messages in the relevant time period, and Bannon also stated he did not
know why messages did not appear on his device.!”® Bannon told the Office that, during both the
months before and after the Seychelles meeting, he regularly used his personal Blackberry and

new Administration took power, and before Cabinet nominees had been confirmed by the

were on the topics of reconciliation with Russia, joint security concerns, and economic matters.!!%

worthwhile, Dmitriev sent his biography to Gerson and asked him if he could “share it with Jared

dates, but Kushner’s assistant indicated that Kislyak was very insistent about securing a second

embassy official Sergey Kuznetsov wrote to Berkowitz that Kislyak thought it “important” to
“continue the conversation with Mr. Kushner in person,”!!'* Kislyak nonetheless agreed to meet

the meeting and that no one on the Transition Team even did a Google search for
Gorkov’s name. !

At the start of the meeting, Gorkov presented Kushner with two gifts: a painting and a bag
of soil from the town in Belarus where Kushner’s family originated.''>®

The accounts from Kushner and Gorkov differ as to whether the meeting was diplomatic
or business in nature. Kushner told the Office that the meeting was diplomatic, with Gorkov
expressing disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for
improved relations with the incoming Administration.''*” According to Kushner, although Gorkov
told Kushner a little bit about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy, the
two did not discuss Kushner’s companies or private business dealings of any kind.''*® (At the time
of the meeting, Kushner Companies had a debt obligation coming due on the building it owned at
666 Fifth Avenue, and there had been public reporting both about efforts to secure lending on the
property and possible conflicts of interest for Kushner arising out of his company’s borrowing
from foreign lenders.''%%)

In contrast, in a 2017 public statement, VEB suggested Gorkov met with Kushner in
Kushner’s capacity as CEO of Kushner Companies for the purpose of discussing business, rather
than as part of a diplomatic effort. In particular, VEB characterized Gorkov’s meeting with
Kushner as part of a series of “roadshow meetings” with “representatives of major US banks and
business circles,” which included “negotiations” and discussion of the “most promising business
lines and sectors.”!'6°

Foresman, the investment bank executive mentioned in Volume I, Sections IV.A.]1 and
IV.B.3, supra, told the Office that he met with Gorkov and VEB deputy chairman Nikolay
Tsekhomsky in Moscow just before Gorkov left for New York to meet Kushner.''S! According to
Foresman, Gorkov and Tsekhomsky told him that they were traveling to New York to discuss post-
election issues with U.S. financial institutions, that their trip was sanctioned by Putin, and that they
would be reporting back to Putin upon their return.''62

The investigation did not resolve the apparent conflict in the accounts of Kushner and
Gorkov or determine whether the meeting was diplomatic in nature (as Kushner stated), focused
on business (as VEB’s public statement indicated), or whether it involved some combination of
those matters or other matters. Regardless, the investigation did not identify evidence that Kushner
and Gorkov engaged in any substantive follow-up after the meeting.

Rather, a few days after the meeting, Gorkov’s assistant texted Kushner’s assistant, “Hi,
please inform your side that the information about the meeting had a very positive response!”!'
Over the following weeks, the two assistants exchanged a handful of additional cordial texts.!'*
On February 8, 2017, Gorkov’s assistant texted Kushner’s assistant (Berkowitz) to try to set up
another meeting, and followed up by text at least twice in the days that followed.!'®® According
to Berkowitz, he did not respond to the meeting request in light of the press coverage regarding
the Russia investigation, and did not tell Kushner about the meeting request. Ling

5. Petr Aven’s Qutreach Efforts to the Transition Team

In December 2016, weeks after the one-on-one meeting with Putin described in Volume I,
Section IV.B.1.b, supra, Petr Aven attended what he described as a separate “all-hands” oligarch
meeting between Putin and Russia’s most prominent businessmen.!'®” As in Aven’s one-on-one
meeting, a main topic of discussion at the oligarch meeting in December 2016 was the prospect of
forthcoming U.S. economic sanctions.!!%®

After the December 2016 all-hands meeting, Aven tried to establish a connection to the
Trump team. Aven instructed Richard Burt to make contact with the incoming Trump
Administration. Burt was on the board of directors for LetterOne (L1), another company headed
by Aven, and had done work for Alfa-Bank.!'®® Burt had previously served as U.S. ambassador
to Germany and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, and one of his
primary roles with Alfa-Bank and L1 was to facilitate introductions to business contacts in the
United States and other Western countries.''”

While at a L1 board meeting held in Luxembourg in late December 2016, Aven pulled Burt
aside and told him that he had spoken to someone high in the Russian government who expressed

interest in establishing a communications channel between the Kremlin and the Trump Transition
Team.!"”! Aven asked for Burt’s help in contacting members of the Transition Team.''”* Although
Burt had been responsible for helping Aven build connections in the past, Burt viewed Aven’s
request as unusual and outside the normal realm of his dealings with Aven.''”

Burt, who is a member of the board of CNI (discussed at Volume I, Section IV.A.4,
supra),"'* decided to approach CNI president Dimitri Simes for help facilitating Aven’s request,
recalling that Simes had some relationship with Kushner.''” At the time, Simes was lobbying the
Trump Transition Team, on Burt’s behalf, to appoint Burt U.S. ambassador to Russia.''”®

Burt contacted Simes by telephone and asked if he could arrange a meeting with Kushner
to discuss setting up a high-level communications channel between Putin and the incoming
Administration.'”” Simes told the Office that he declined and stated to Burt that setting up such
a channel was not a good idea in light of the media attention surrounding Russian influence in the
U.S. presidential election.!'” According to Simes, he understood that Burt was seeking a secret
channel, and Simes did not want CNI to be seen as an intermediary between the Russian
government and the incoming Administration.''” Based on what Simes had read in the media, he
stated that he already had concerns that Trump’s business connections could be exploited by
Russia, and Simes said that he did not want CNI to have any involvement or apparent involvement
in facilitating any connection, '

In an email dated December 22, 2016, Burt recounted for Aven his conversation with
Simes:

Through a trusted third party, I have reached out to the very influential person I mentioned
in Luxembourg concerning Project A. There is an interest and an understanding for the
need to establish such a channel. But the individual emphasized that at this moment, with
so much intense interest in the Congress and the media over the question of cyber-hacking
(and who ordered what), Project A was too explosive to discuss. The individual agreed to
discuss it again after the New Year. I trust the individual’s instincts on this.

If this is unclear or you would like to discuss, don’t hesitate to call.!'®!

According to Burt, the “very influential person” referenced in his email was Simes, and the
reference to a “trusted third party” was a fabrication, as no such third party existed. “Project A”
was a term that Burt created for Aven’s effort to help establish a communications channel between
Russia and the Trump team, which he used in light of the sensitivities surrounding what Aven was
requesting, especially in light of the recent attention to Russia’s influence in the U.S. presidential
election.'"® According to Burt, his report that there was “interest” in a communications channel
reflected Simes’s views, not necessarily those of the Transition Team, and in any event, Burt
acknowledged that he added some “hype” to that sentence to make it sound like there was more
interest from the Transition Team than may have actually existed.!!*?

Aven replied to Burt’s email on the same day, saying “Thank you. All clear.”!!
According to Aven, this statement indicated that he did not want the outreach to continue.''* Burt
spoke to Aven some time thereafter about his attempt to make contact with the Trump team,
explaining to Aven that the current environment made it impossible, ﬁ

1186 Burt did not recall discussing Aven’s request with Simes again, nor did
he recall speaking to anyone else about the request.''®’

to create a back channel between the Russian government and the Trump Administration.''?

7. Contacts With and Through Michael T. Flynn

Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was the Transition Team’s primary
conduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt with Russia on two sensitive
matters during the transition period: a United Nations Security Council vote and the Russian
government’s reaction to the United States’s imposition of sanctions for Russian interference in
the 2016 election.'®” Despite Kushner’s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside
the Russian government, the Transition Team turned to Flynn’s relationship with Kislyak on
both issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming deputy,
to prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect and other senior
members of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time. Although transition officials at Mar-
a-Lago had some concern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did
not identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn
asked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on December 29,
2016, and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that request.

a. United Nations Vote on Israeli Settlements

On December 21, 2016, Egypt submitted a resolution to the United Nations Security
Council calling on Israel to cease settlement activities in Palestinian territory.”™®® The Security
Council, which includes Russia, was scheduled to vote on the resolution the following day.'*
There was speculation in the media that the Obama Administration would not oppose the
resolution.'?'°

According to Flynn, the Transition Team regarded the vote as a significant issue and
wanted to support Israel by opposing the resolution.'?!! On December 22, 2016, multiple members
of the Transition Team, as well as President-Elect Trump, communicated with foreign government
officials to determine their views on the resolution and to rally support to delay the vote or defeat
the resolution.'?'? Kushner led the effort for the Transition Team; Flynn was responsible for the
Russian government.'?!* Minutes after an early morning phone call with Kushner on December
22, Flynn called Kislyak.'*'* According to Flynn, he informed Kislyak about the vote and the
Transition Team’s opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the
resolution.'?® Later that day, President-Elect Trump spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah
al-Sisi about the vote.!?!® Ultimately, Egypt postponed the vote.'?!?

On December 23, 2016, Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal, and Venezuela resubmitted the
resolution.'?'® Throughout the day, members of the Transition Team continued to talk with foreign
leaders about the resolution, with Flynn continuing to lead the outreach with the Russian
government through Kislyak.!?"* When Flynn again spoke with Kislyak, Kislyak informed Flynn
that if the resolution came to a vote, Russia would not vote against it.'*? The resolution later
passed 14-0, with the United States abstaining.'*'

In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and
individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to
the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances
the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the
Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference
activities.

V. PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS

The Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel’s Office “to prosecute federal
crimes arising from [its] investigation” of the matters assigned to it. In deciding whether to
exercise this prosecutorial authority, the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal
Prosecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney’s) Manual. In particular, the Office
has evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for prosecution constituted a
federal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain
a conviction for such an offense. Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those
questions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial
federal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction, and
there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution. Id.

As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of

Russian nationals for their roles in perpetrating the active-measures social media campaign and
R s e Harm to Ongoing Matter

    
 
 
 

   

 
 

The Office
similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals
either did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of campaign-finance
offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction. At the
same time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging
certain individuals connected to the Campaign with making false statements or otherwise
obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations.

A. Russian “Active Measures” Social Media Campaign

On February 16, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an
indictment charging 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities—including the Internet
Research Agency (IRA) and Concord Management and Consulting LLC (Concord)—with
violating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes.'*®
The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count
One), three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud (Count Two), and
five defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight). Internet Research
Agency Indictment. Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One conspiracy,
entered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to dismiss the charge on multiple grounds.
In orders and memorandum opinions issued on August 13 and November 15, 2018, the district
court denied Concord’s motions to dismiss. United States v. Concord Management & Consulting
LLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38 (D.D.C. 2018). United States v. Concord Management & Consulting
LLC, 317 F. Supp. 3d 598 (D.D.C. 2018). As of this writing, the prosecution of Concord remains
ongoing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The other defendants remain
at large.

 

1276 A more detailed explanation of the charging decision in this case is set forth in a separate
memorandum provided to the Acting Attorney General before the indictment.

174


==================== PAGE 184 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney-WerlcProduet // May-Contatn-Material Proteeted-UnderFed-R—Crim—P-6(e)

Although members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump
Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S. person
with participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did not identify evidence
that any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was
speaking with Russian nationals engaged in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore
determined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge
them in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging
a wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Russian nationals (Count
Two).

The Office did, however, charge one U.S. national for his role in supplying false or stolen
bank account numbers that allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems
by circumventing those systems’ security features. On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded
guilty, pursuant to a single-count information, to identity fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1028(a)(7) and (b)(1)(D). Plea Agreement, United States v. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24
(D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2018), Doc. 10. The investigation did not establish that Pinedo was aware of the
identity of the IRA members who purchased bank account numbers from him. Pinedo’s sales of
account numbers enabled the IRA members to anonymously access a financial network through
which they transacted with U.S. persons and companies. See Gov’t Sent. Mem. at 3, United States
v. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 (D.D.C. Sept. 26, 2018), Doc. 24. On October 10, 2018, Pinedo
was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be followed by six months of home confinement,
and was ordered to complete 100 hours of community setvice.

B. Russian Hacking and Dumping Operations
1. Section 1030 Computer-Intrusion Conspiracy
a. Background

On July 13, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment
charging Russian military intelligence officers from the GRU with conspiring to hack into various
U.S. computers used by the Clinton Campaign, DNC, DCCC, and other U.S. persons, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030 and 371 (Count One); committing identity theft and conspiring to commit
money laundering in furtherance of that hacking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028A
and 1956(h) (Counts Two through Ten); and a separate conspiracy to hack into the computers of
U.S. persons and entities responsible for the administration of the 2016 U.S. election, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030 and 371 (Count Eleven). Netyksho Indictment.'?”” As of this writing, all 12
defendants remain at large.

The Netyksho indictment alleges that the defendants conspired with one another and with
others to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to
interfere in the election. Nefyksho Indictment § 2. The indictment also describes how, in staging

the releases, the defendants used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to disseminate documents through
WikiLeaks. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released over 20,000 emails and other documents that
the hacking conspirators had stolen from the DNC. Netyksho Indictment § 48. In addition, on
October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing emails that some conspirators had stolen from Clinton
Campaign chairman John Podesta after a successful spearphishing operation. Netyksho
Indictment 9 49.

1278 The Office also considered, but ruled out, charges on the theory that the post-hacking sharing
and dissemination of emails could constitute trafficking in or receipt of stolen property under the National
Stolen Property Act (NSPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 2315. The statutes comprising the NSPA cover
“goods, wares, or merchandise,” and lower courts have largely understood that phrase to be limited to
tangible items since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985). See
United States v. Yijia Zhang, 995 F. Supp. 2d 340, 344-48 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (collecting cases). One of those
post-Dowling decisions—United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1991)—specifically held that
the NSPA does not reach “a computer program in source code form,” even though that code was stored in
tangible items (7.e., a hard disk and in a three-ring notebook). Id. at 1302-03. Congress, in turn, cited the
Brown opinion in explaining the need for amendments to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2) that “would ensure that
the theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft
of physical items [is] protected.” 8. Rep. 104-357, at 7 (1996). That sequence of events would make it
difficult to argue that hacked emails in electronic form, which are the relevant stolen items here, constitute
“goods, wares, or merchandise” within the meaning of the NSPA.

2. Potential Section 1030 Violation By [ NG

 

 

  

See United States v.
Willis, 476 F.3d 1121, 1125 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that the 1986 amendments to Section
1030 reflect Congress’s desire to reach “‘intentional acts of unauthorized access—rather than
mistaken, inadvertent, or careless ones’) (quoting S. Rep. 99-432, at 5 (1986)). In addition, the
computer likely qualifies as a “protected” one under the statute, which
reaches “effectively all computers with Internet access.” United States v. Nosal, 676 F.3d 854,

859 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc).

 

   
   
  

Applying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, however, the Office determined that
prosecution of this potential violation was not warranted. Those Principles instruct prosecutors to
consider, among other things, the nature and seriousness of the offense, the person’s culpability in
connection with the offense, and the probable sentence to be imposed if the prosecution is
successful. Justice Manual § 9-27.230.

C. Russian Government Qutreach and Contacts

As explained in Section IV above, the Office’s investigation uncovered evidence of
numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or
claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several
sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate
in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges
under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above—with the
exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on
behalf of Ukraine.

One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals—
the June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising
derogatory information on Hillary Clinton—implicates an additional body of law: campaign-
finance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources
raise difficult statutory and constitutional questions. As explained below, the Office evaluated
those questions in connection with the June 9 meetmg
The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questlons were resolved favorably

to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or
individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law.

Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-
affiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several
U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other
steps to obstruct the Office’s investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore
charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice.

1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion

As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the
collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of “collusion,” but through the lens
of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]” appears in the
Acting Attorney General’s August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public
reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or
theory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the
contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as
that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371. See Black’s Law
Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is “[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain
something forbidden by law”); 1 Alexander Burrill, 4 Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871)
(“An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ
such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.”}; 1 Bouvier’s Law Dictionary 352

180


==================== PAGE 190 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney—WerkProduet // Meay-Contain-Material Proteeted-tnderFed—R—Crim—P—6(e)

(1897) (“An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms
of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.”).

For that reason, this Office’s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was
on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term “collusion.” The Office
considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked
individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy—either under statutes that have their
own conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1349, 1951(a)), or under the general conspiracy
statute (18 U.S.C. § 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume
I, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal
criminal law—including foreign-influence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are
discussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the
Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either
under a specific statute or under Section 371°s offenses clause.

The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under
Section 371’s defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a
lawful function of the U.S. government or its agencies through deceitful or dishonest means. See
Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 861 (1966); Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S.
182, 188 (1924); see aiso United States v. Concord Mgmt. & Consulting LLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38,
46 (D.D.C. 2018). The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign officials—
or between such officials and Russia-linked individuals—to interfere with or obstruct a lawful
function of a government agency during the campaign or transition period. And, as discussed in
Volume I, Section V.A, supra, the investigation did not identify evidence that any Campaign
official or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the
Office charged, namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in Volume 1, Section 11, supra.
Accordingly, the Office did not charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with
conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-related contacts described in Section
IV above.

2. Potential Coordination: Foreign Agent Statutes (FARA and 18 U.S.C. § 951)

The Office next assessed the potential liability of Campaign-affiliated individuals under
federal statutes regulating actions on behalf of, or work done for, a foreign government.

a. Governing Law

Under 18 U.S.C. § 951, it is generally illegal to act in the United States as an agent of a
foreign government without providing notice to the Attorney General. Although the defendant
must act on behalf of a foreign government (as opposed to other kinds of foreign entities), the acts
need not involve espionage; rather, acts of any type suffice for liability. See United States v.
Duran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Latchin, 554 ¥.3d 709, 715 (7th
Cir. 2009); United States v. Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566, 581 (7th Cir. 2005). An “agent of a foreign
government” is an “individual” who “agrees to operate” in the United States “subject to the
direction or control of a foreign government or official.” 18 U.S.C. § 951(d).

181


==================== PAGE 191 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

   

The crime defined by Section 951 is complete upon knowingly acting in the United States
as an unregistered foreign-government agent. 18 U.S.C. § 951(a). The statute does not require
willfulness, and knowledge of the notification requirement is not an element of the offense. Unifed
States v. Campa, 529 F.3d 980, 998-99 (11th Cir. 2008); Duran, 596 F.3d at 1291-94; Dumeisi,
424 F.3d at 581.

The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) generally makes it illegal to act as an agent
of a foreign principal by engaging in certain (largely political) activities in the United States
without registering with the Attorney General. 22 U.S.C. §§ 611-621. The triggering agency
relationship must be with a foreign principal or “a person any of whose activities are directly or
indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a
foreign principal.” 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1). That includes a foreign government or political party
and various foreign individuals and entities. 22 U.S.C. § 611(b). A covered relationship exists if
a person “acts as an agent, representative, employee, or servant” or “in any other capacity at the
order, request, or under the [foreign principal’s] direction or control.” 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1). It
is sufficient if the person “agrees, consents, assumes or purports to act as, or who is or holds

himself out to be, whether or not pursuant to contractual relationship, an agent of a foreign
principal.” 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(2).

The triggering activity is that the agent “directly or through any other person” in the United
States (1) engages in “political activities for or in the interests of [the] foreign principal,” which
includes attempts to influence federal officials or the public; (2) acts as “public relations counsel,
publicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such
foreign principal”; (3) “solicits, collects, disburses, or dispenses contributions, loans, money, or
other things of value for or in the interest of such foreign principal”; or (4) “represents the interests
of such foreign principal” before any federal agency or official. 22 U.S.C. § 611(c)(1).

It is a crime to engage in a “[w]illful violation of any provision of the Act or any regulation
thereunder.” 22 U.S.C. § 618(a)(1). It is also a crime willfully to make false statements or
omissions of material facts in FARA registration statements or supplements. 22 U.S.C.
§ 618(a)(2). Most violations have a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment and a $10,000
fine. 22 U.S.C. § 618.

b. Application

The investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort’s and Richard Gates’s
pre-campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA. Manafort and Gates were
charged for that conduct and admitted to it when they pleaded guilty to superseding criminal
informations in the District of Columbia prosecution.'”®® The evidence underlying those charges

prosecution memorandum submitted to the Acting Attorney General before the original indictment
in that case.

In addition, the investigation produced evidence of FARA violations involving Michael
Flynn. Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (i.e., Turkey)
and were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts in the Statement of Offense that
accompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge. Statement of Offense, United States v.
Michael T. Flynn, No. 1:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 4 (“Flynn Statement of
Offense”).!?8

The investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any
individual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agent of a foreign principal within the
meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government
of Russia, or any official thereof. In particular, the Office did not find evidence likely to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos,
and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government—or at its direction, control, or
request—during the relevant time period.'

    
      

As a result, the Office did not charge any other Trump Campaign official with violating
FARA or Section 951, or attempting or conspiring to do so, based on contacts with the Russian
government or a Russian principal.

Finally, the Office investigated whether one of the above campaign advisors—George
Papadopoulos—acted as an agent of, or at the direction and control of, the government of Israel.
While the investigation revealed significant ties between Papadopoulos and Israel (and search
warrants were obtained in part on that basis), the Office ultimately determined that the evidence
was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA or Section 951.

3. Campaign Finance

Several areas of the Office’s investigation involved efforts or offers by foreign nationals to
provide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign or to distribute that
information to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign. As explained below, the
Office considered whether two of those efforts in particular—the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump

1282 On four occasions, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued warrants based
on a finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(b),
1805(a)(2)(A). The FISC’s probable-cause finding was based on a different (and lower) standard than the
one governing the Office’s decision whether to bring charges against Page, which is whether admissible
evidence would likely be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Page acted as an agent of the
Russian Federation during the period at issue. Cf. United States v. Cardoza, 713 F.3d 656, 660 (D.C. Cir.
2013) (explaining that probable cause requires only “a fair probability,” and not “certainty, or proof beyond
a reasonable doubt, or proof by a preponderance of the evidence”).

IyogHarm to Ongoing Matter —constituted prosecutable violations of
the campaign-finance laws. The Office determined that the evidence was not sufficient to charge
either incident as a criminal violation.

a. Overview Of Governing Law

“[TThe United States has a compelling interest . . . in limiting the participation of foreign
citizens in activities of democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign influence
over the U.S. political process.” Bluman v. FEC, 800 F. Supp. 2d 281, 288 (D.D.C. 2011)
(Kavanaugh, I., for three-judge court), aff’d, 565 U.S. 1104 (2012). To that end, federal campaign-
finance law broadly prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions, donations,
expenditures, or other disbursements in connection with federal, state, or local candidate elections,
and prohibits anyone from soliciting, accepting, or receiving such contributions or donations. As
relevant here, foreign nationals may not make—and no one may “solicit, accept, or receive” from
them—*a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value” or “an express or implied
promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election.”
52 U.S.C. §30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)."** The term “contribution,” which is used throughout the
campaign-finance law, “includes” “any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or
anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal
office.” 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, “the value of [volunteer]
services.” 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(B)(i).

Foreign nationals are also barred from making “an expenditure, independent expenditure,
or disbursement for an electioneering communication.” 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(C). The term
“expenditure” “includes” “any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of
money or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for
Federal office.” 52 U.S.C. § 30101(9)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, news stories and
non-partisan get-out-the-vote activities. 52 U.S.C. § 30101(9)(B)(i)-(ii). An “independent
expenditure” is an expenditure “expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified
candidate” and made independently of the campaign. 52 U.S.C. § 30101(17). An “electioneering
communication” is a broadcast communication that “refers to a clearly identified candidate for
Federal office” and is made within specified time periods and targeted at the relevant electorate.
52 U.S.C. § 30104(DH)(3).

The statute defines “foreign national” by reference to FARA and the Immigration and
Nationality Act, with minor modification. 52 U.S.C. § 30121(b) (cross-referencing 22 U.S.C.
§ 611(b)(1)-(3) and 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(20), (22)). That definition yields five, sometimes-
overlapping categories of foreign nationals, which include all of the individuals and entities
relevant for present purposes—namely, foreign governments and political parties, individuals

 

1283 Campaign-finance law also places financial limits on contributions, 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a), and
prohibits contributions from corporations, banks, and labor unions, 52 U.S.C. § 30118(a); see Citizens
United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 320 (2010). Because the conduct that the Office investigated involved
possible electoral activity by foreign nationals, the foreign-contributions ban is the most readily applicable
provision.

outside of the U.S. who are not legal permanent residents, and certain non-U.S. entities located
outside of the U.S. '

A “knowing[] and willful[]” violation involving an aggregate of $25,000 or more in a
calendar year is a felony. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)(i); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292
(noting that a willful violation will require some “proof of the defendant’s knowledge of the law);
United States v. Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d 573, 577 (E.D. Va. 2013) (applying willfulness
standard drawn from Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 191-92 (1998)); see also Wagner v.
FEC,793F.3d 1,19n.23 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (en banc) (same). A “knowing[] and willful[]” violation
involving an aggregate of $2,000 or more in a calendar year, but less than $25,000, is a
misdemeanor. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)}(1)(A)(ii).

b. Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting

The Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in
connection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office
concluded that, in light of the government’s substantial burden of proof on issues of intent
(“knowing” and “willful”), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information,
criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that “the admissible evidence will
probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.” Justice Manual § 9-27.220.

In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump
Jr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an “offer” from Russia’s “Crown prosecutor” to
“the Trump campaign” of “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and
her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.’s] father.” The email described
this as “very high level and sensitive information” that is “part of Russia and its government’s
support to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin.” Trump Jr. responded: “if it’s what you
say I love it especially later in the summer.” Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had follow-up
conversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was
attended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and
the attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign
anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that
could assist candidate Trump’s electoral prospects.

This series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and
donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along
an offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide “official documents and
information” to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the presidential election.
Trump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those
materials., Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner
and Manafort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt
of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources.

The Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the

foreign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; the solicitation of an illegal foreign-
source contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of “an express or implied promise to make a

185


==================== PAGE 195 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney-WeorlePreduet // May-ContainMaterial-Protested-tnderFedR—Crim—P6(e)

[foreign-source] contribution,” both in violation of 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). There are
reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a “thing of value” within the
meaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to
obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did not obtain admissible
evidence likely to meet the government’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these
individuals acted “willfully,” i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and,
second, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt
that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52

U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)().
i. Thing-of-Value Element

A threshold legal question is whether providing to a campaign “documents and
information” of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution. The
foreign contribution ban is not limited to contributions of money. It expressly prohibits “a
contribution or donation of money or other thing of value.” 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)
(emphasis added). And the term “contribution” is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws
to “include[]” “any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value.”
52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added).

The phrases “thing of value” and “anything of value” are broad and inclusive enough to
encompass at least some forms of valuable information. Throughout the United States Code, these
phrases serve as “term[s] of art” that are construed “broad[ly].” United States v. Nilsen, 967 F.2d
539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (“thing of value” includes “both tangibles and intangibles”);
see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(1), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id. § 641 (theft of government
property). For example, the term “thing of value” encompasses law enforcement reports that
would reveal the identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979),
classified materials, United States v. Fowler, 932 F.2d 306, 310 (4th Cir. 1991); confidential
information about a competitive bid, United States v. Matzkin, 14 F.3d 1014, 1020 (4th Cir. 1994),
secret grand jury information, United States v. Jeter, 775 F.2d 670, 680 (6th Cir. 1985); and
information about a witness’s whereabouts, United States v. Sheker, 618 F.2d 607, 609 (9th Cir.
1980) (per curiam). And in the public corruption context, “‘thing of value’ is defined broadly to
include the value which the defendant subjectively attaches to the items received.” United States
v. Renzi, 769 F.3d 731, 744 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations recognize the value to a campaign of at
least some forms of information, stating that the term “anything of value™ includes “the provision
of any goods or services without charge,” such as “membership lists” and “mailing lists.” 11
C.F.R. § 100.52(d)(1). The FEC has concluded that the phrase includes a state-by-state list of
activists. See Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. FEC, 475 F.3d 337, 338
(D.C. Cir. 2007) (describing the FEC’s findings). Likewise, polling data provided to a campaign
constitutes a “contribution.” FEC Advisory Opinion 1990-12 (Strub), 1990 WL 153454 (citing 11
C.F.R. § 106.4(b)). And in the specific context of the foreign-contributions ban, the FEC has
concluded that “election materials used in previous Canadian campaigns,” including “flyers,
advertisements, door hangers, tri-folds, signs, and other printed material,” constitute “anything of

186


==================== PAGE 196 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney—WorlProduet // May-ContainMaterialProtected-UnderFed-R—Crim—P—6(e)

value,” even though “the value of these materials may be nominal or difficult to ascertain.” FEC
Advisory Opinion 2007-22 (Hurysz), 2007 WL 5172375, at *5.

These authorities would support the view that candidate-related opposition research given
to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which
the foreign-source ban could apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds,
but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns
frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged in such research
and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and
a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things
of value. At the same time, no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of
uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount
to a contribution under campaign-finance law. Such an interpretation could have implications
beyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign
contributions), and raise First Amendment questions. Those questions could be especially difficult
where the information consisted simply of the recounting of historically accurate facts. It is
uncertain how courts would resolve those issues.

ii. Willfulness

Even assuming that the promised “documents and information that would incriminate
Hillary” constitute a “thing of value” under campaign-finance law, the government would
encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Most significantly, the
government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement
beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant acted “knowingly and willfully,” the
government would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was
unlawful. U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec.
2017) (“Election Offenses”); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation
requires “proof of the defendant’s knowledge of the law™); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577
(“knowledge of general unlawfulness™). “This standard creates an elevated scienter element
requiring, at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear. When
there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the
offender is more likely to have an intent defense.” Election Offenses 123.

On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.
The investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar
with the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context.
The government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or efforts at concealment
at the time of the June 9 meeting. While the government has evidence of later efforts to prevent
disclosure of the nature of the June 9 meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a
showing of scienter, see Volume II, Section II.G, infra, that concealment occurred more than a
year later, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting, and may reflect an intention
to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality. Additionally, in light
of the unresolved legal questions about whether giving “documents and information” of the sort
offered here constitutes a campaign contribution, Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he

187


==================== PAGE 197 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney WetlkProduet // May-Contain-Material Protected-UndertedR—-Crim—P—6(e)

did not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law. Given his
less direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar
defense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has not
developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues.

iii. Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information

The Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the
value of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal
violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1).
The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions—such
as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost
or the cost of distribution—would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting.
Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that the
information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy
may well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement,
see, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone’s description
of the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the information’s value—i.e.,
that it would “incriminate Hillary” and “would be very useful to [Trump Jr.’s] father”—was non-
specific and may have been understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given
Goldstone’s lack of direct access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be
delivered could be reflected in Trump Jr.’s response (“if it’s what you say 1 love it”) (emphasis
added).

Accordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a
campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office
decided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign
officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting.

il. Willfulness

As discussed, to establish a criminal campaign-finance violation, the government must
prove that the defendant acted “knowingly and willfully.” 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)(i). That
standard requires proof that the defendant knew generally that his conduct was unlawful. Election
Offenses 123. Given the uncertainties noted above, the “willfulness” requirement would pose a
substantial barrier to prosecution.

4, False Statements and Obstruction of the Investigation

The Office determined that certain individuals associated with the Campaign lied to
investigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken other actions to interfere with
the investigation. As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected
to the Campaign with false statements and obstruction offenses.

a. Overview Of Governing Law

False Statements. The principal federal statute criminalizing false statements to
government investigators is 18 U.S.C. § 1001. As relevant here, under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a
crime to knowingly and willfully “make[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement
or representation” “in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive . . . branch of the
Government.” An FBI investigation is a matter within the Executive Branch’s jurisdiction. Unifed
States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479 (1984). The statute also applies to a subset of legislative
branch actions—viz., administrative matters and “investigation[s] or review[s]” conducted by a
congressional committee or subcommittee. 18 U.S.C. § 1001(c)(1) and (2); see United States v.

Pickett, 353 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2004).

Whether the statement was made to law enforcement or congressional investigators, the
government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non-jurisdictional elements:
the statement was false, fictitious, or fraudulent; the defendant knew both that it was false and that
it was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false statement was material. See, e.g., United
States v. Smith, 831 F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements}; see also Ninth Circuit
Pattern Instruction 8.73 & cmt. (explaining that the Section 1001 jury instruction was modified in
light of the Department of Justice’s position that the phrase “knowingly and willfully” in the statute
requires the defendant’s knowledge that his or her conduct was unlawful). In the D.C. Circuit, the
government must prove that the statement was actually false; a statement that is misleading but
“literally true” does not satisfy Section 1001(a)(2). See United States v. Milton, 8 F.3d 39, 45

191


==================== PAGE 201 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

   

(D.C. Cir. 1993); United States v. Dale, 991 F.2d 819, 832-33 & n.22 (D.C. Cir. 1993). For that
false statement to qualify as “material,” it must have a natural tendency to influence, or be capable
of influencing, a discrete decision or any other function of the agency to which it is addressed. See
United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Moore, 612 F.3d 698, 701
(D.C. Cir. 2010).

Perjury. Under the federal perjury statutes, it is a crime for a witness testifying under oath
before a grand jury to knowingly make any false material declaration. See 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The
government must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction under
Section 1623(a): the defendant testified under oath before a federal grand jury; the defendant’s
testimony was false in one or more respects; the false testimony concerned matters that were
material to the grand jury investigation; and the false testimony was knowingly given. Uhited
States v. Bridges, 717 F.2d 1444, 1449 n.30 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The general perjury statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1621, also applies to grand jury testimony and has similar elements, except that it requires
that the witness have acted willfully and that the government satisfy “strict common-law
requirements for establishing falsity.” See Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 & n.6 (1979)
(explaining “the two-witness rule” and the corroboration that it demands).

Obstruction of Justice. Three basic elements are common to the obstruction statutes
pertinent to this Office’s charging decisions: an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the
obstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal (i.e., corrupt) intent. A detailed discussion
of those elements, and the law governing obstruction of justice more generally, is included in
Volume II of the report.

b. Application to Certain Individuals
i. George Papadopoulos

Investigators approached Papadopoulos for an interview based on his role as a foreign
policy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to a foreign government representative
that Russia had indicated that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of
information damaging to candidate Clinton. On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be
interviewed by FBI agents, who informed him that the interview was part of the investigation into
potential Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election.

During the interview, Papadopoulos lied about the timing, extent, and nature of his
communications with Joseph Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya, and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to
timing, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians
had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” But Papadopoulos stated multiple
times that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campaign and that it was a
“yery strange coincidence” to be told of the “dirt” before he started working for the Campaign.
This account was false. Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March 14,
2016, after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the
Campaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos only after learning of his role on the
Campaign. And Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the Russians possessing “dirt” on candidate
Clinton in late April 2016, more than a month after Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and

been publicly announced by candidate Trump. Statement of Offense Y 25-26, United States v.
George Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Oct. 5,2017), Doc. 19 (“Papadopoulos Statement
of Offense™).

Papadopoulos also made false statements in an effort to minimize the extent and
importance of his communications with Mifsud. For example, Papadopoulos stated that
“[Mifsud]’s a nothing,” that he thought Mifsud was “just a guy talk[ing] up connections or
something,” and that he believed Mifsud was “BS’ing to be completely honest with you.” In fact,
however, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to have substantial connections to high-level Russian
government officials and that Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling
Papadopoulos about the “dirt.” Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over a
period of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign, including efforts to
arrange a “history making” meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials. In
addition, Papadopoulos failed to inform investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev,
the Russian national who Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or “[a]nyone with a
Russian accent” during the campaign. Papadopoulos Statement of Offense | 27-29.

Papadopoulos also falsely claimed that he met Polonskaya before he joined the Campaign,
and falsely told the IBI that he had “no” relationship at all with her. He stated that the extent of
their communications was her sending emails—"“Just, ‘Hi, how are you?’ That’s it.” In truth,
however, Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he had joined the Campaign; he
believed that she had connections to high-level Russian government officials and could help him
arrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia. During the campaign he emailed and spoke with
her over Skype on numerous occasions about the potential foreign policy trip to Russia.

Papadopoulos Statement of Offense 7 30-31.

Papadopoulos’s false statements in January 2017 impeded the FBI’s investigation into
Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, those statements
hindered investigators’ ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby
of a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017. See Gov’t Sent. Mem. at 6, United States v.
George Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44. During that interview,
Mifsud admitted to knowing Papadopoulos and to having introduced him to Polonskaya and
Timofeev. But Mifsud denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of
emails damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed
cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their
conversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulos since the meeting at
which Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even though emails, text messages, and other
information show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions—April 12
and April 26, 2016. In addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up
message that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that, as reflected
in the language of that email chain (“Baby, thank you!”), Mifsud may have been involved in a
personal relationship with Polonskaya at the time. The false information and omissions in
Papadopoulos’s January 2017 interview undermined investigators’ ability to challenge Mifsud
when he made these inaccurate statements.

Given the seriousness of the lies and omissions and their effect on the FBI’s investigation,
the Office charged Papadopoulos with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1001. Information, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C, Oct. 3,
2017), Doc. 8. On October 7, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to that charge pursuant to a plea
agreement, On September 7, 2018, he was sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, a $9,500 fine,
and 200 hours of community service.

 

iii. Michael Flynn

Michael Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI on January 24, 2017, four days after he
had officially assumed his duties as National Security Advisor to the President. During the
interview, Flynn made several false statements pertaining to his communications with the Russian
ambassador.

First, Flynn made two false statements about his conversations with Russian Ambassador
Kislyak in late December 2016, at a time when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia
for interfering with the 2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response. See
Flynn Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain from
escalating the situation in response to the United States’s imposition of sanctions. That statement
was false. On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to request Russian restraint. Flynn made
the call immediately after speaking to a senior Transition Team official (IK.T. McFarland) about
what to communicate to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to
report on the substance of that conversation. Flynn also falsely told the FBI that he did not
remember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate
its response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of Flynn’s request. On December 31, 2016, Flynn in
fact had such a conversation with Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the
call to relay the substance of his conversation with Kislyak. See Flynn Statement of Offense § 3.

==================== PAGE 204 ====================

Attorney-WorlcProduet // May-Containr-Material-Proteeted-Under Fed—R—Crim—P—6(e)

Second, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to representatives
of Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations
Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that he only asked the
countries’ positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he did not request that any
of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That statement was false. On
December 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the incoming Trump Administration’s
opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn
also falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia’s response to his December 22 request
regarding the resolution. Kislyak in fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that
Russia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote. See Flynn Statement of Offense

q 4.

Flynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as National
Security Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian interference in the 2016
presidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia.
Flynn’s false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on that
ongoing investigation. Flynn Statement of Offense | 1-2. They also came shortly before Flynn
made separate submissions to the Department of Justice, pursuant to FARA, that also contained
materially false statements and omissions. /d. § 5. Based on the totality of that conduct, the Office
decided to charge Flynn with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1001(a). On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that
charge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing. See id.; Plea
Agreement, United States v. Michael T. Flynn, No. 1:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 3.
Flynn is awaiting sentencing.

iv. Michael Cohen

Michael Cohen was the executive vice president and special counsel to the Trump
Organization when Trump was president of the Trump Organization. Information 1, United
States v. Cohen, No. 1:18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2018), Doc. 2 (“Cohen Information™). From
the fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen was involved in a project to build a
Trump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow. The project was known as Trump
Tower Moscow.

In 2017, Cohen was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were
investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between
Russia and the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen
caused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow.
Cohen Information 9 2-3. The letter contained three representations relevant here. First, Cohen
stated that the Trump Moscow project had ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate
Trump on the project only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it.
Second, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project
and never considered asking Trump to travel for the project. Third, Cohen stated that he did not
recall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that

195


==================== PAGE 205 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-Wotk Produet // May-Contain-MatetiatProtected-Under Fed—R—Crim—P—6fc)

he had sent to a Russian government email account. Cohen Information 4. Cohen later asked
that his two-page statement be incorporated into his testimony’s transcript before SSCI, and he
ultimately gave testimony to SSCI that was consistent with that statement. Cohen Information 5.

Each of the foregoing representations in Cohen’s two-page statement was false and
misleading. Consideration of the project had extended through approximately June 2016 and
included more than three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed with Felix
Sater his own travel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired about the possibility of
Trump traveling there—both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey
Lewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian
government spokesman Dmitry Peskov—in particular, that he received an email reply and had a
follow-up phone conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016.
Cohen Information § 7. Cohen knew the statements in the letter to be false at the time, and
admitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the project and Trump
(who by this time was President), and (2) to give the false impression that the project had ended
before the first vote in the Republican Party primary process, in the hopes of limiting the ongoing
Russia investigations. Id.

Given the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them during his initial
interview with the Office, we charged Cohen with violating Section 1001. On November 29, 2018,
Cohen pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a single-count information charging him
with making false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) and (c). Cohen Information. The case was transferred to the
district judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern District
of New York (after a referral from our Office). On December 7, 2018, this Office submitted a
letter to that judge recommending that Cohen’s cooperation with our investigation be taken into
account in sentencing Cohen on both the false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern
District prosecution. On December 12, 2018, the judge sentenced Cohen to two months of
imprisonment on the false-statements count, to run concurrently with a 36-month sentence
imposed on the other counts.

vi. Jeff Sessions

As set forth in Volume I, Section IV.A.6, supra, the investigation established that, while a
U.S. Senator and a Trump Campaign advisor, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions interacted
with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention in July
2016 and again at a meeting in Sessions’s Senate office in September 2016. The investigation also
established that Sessions and Kislyak both attended a reception held before candidate Trump’s

197


==================== PAGE 207 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WetleProduet // Meay-ContainMateriat-Protected-bnderFed—R—Crin—P—6(e)

foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in April 2016, and that it is
possible that they met briefly at that reception.

The Office considered whether, in light of these interactions, Sessions committed perjury
before, or made false statements to, Congress in connection with his confirmation as Attorney
General. In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions stated in response
to a question about Trump Campaign communications with the Russian government that he had
“been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and [ didn’t have — did not have
communications with the Russians.” In written responses submitted on January 17,2017, Sessions
answered “[n]o” to a question asking whether he had “been in contact with anyone connected to
any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day.”
And, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony, Sessions identified two of the campaign-period
contacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above, which had been reported in the media following
the January 2017 confirmation hearing. Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did
“not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador, or any other representatives of the
Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion.”

Although the investigation established that Sessions interacted with Kislyak on the
occasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at least one
occasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to
Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions. With respect to
Sessions’s statements that he did “not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador . . .
regarding the political campaign” and he had not been in contact with any Russian official “about
the 2016 election,” the evidence concerning the nature of Sessions’s interactions with Kislyak
makes it plausible that Sessions did not recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of
his statements. Similarly, while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he “did
not have communications with Russians,” he did so in response to a question that had linked such
communications to an alleged “continuing exchange of information” between the Trump
Campaign and Russian government intermediaries. Sessions later explained to the Senate and to
the Office that he understood the question as narrowly calling for disclosure of interactions with
Russians that involved the exchange of campaign information, as distinguished from more routine
contacts with Russian nationals. Given the context in which the question was asked, that
understanding is plausible.

Accordingly, the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Sessions
was willfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a conviction for
perjury or false statements. Consistent with the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office
therefore determined not to pursue charges against Sessions and informed his counsel of that
decision in March 2018.

vii. Others Interviewed During the Investigation
The Office considered whether, during the course of the investigation, other individuals
interviewed either omitted material information or provided information determined to be false.

Applying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office did not seek criminal charges against
any individuals other than those listed above. In some instances, that decision was due to

provided truthful information and that considerations of culpability, deterrence, and resource-

INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME II

This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which
states that, “[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney
General a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special
Counsel] reached.”

Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the
ongoing FBI investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and related
matters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice. The Order appointing the
Special Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that arose directly from the
FBI’s Russia investigation, including whether the President had obstructed justice in connection
with Russia-related investigations. The Special Counsel’s jurisdiction also covered potentially
obstructive acts related to the Special Counsel’s investigation itself. This Volume of our report
summarizes our obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President.

We first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation,
and then provide an overview of this Volume:

First, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to
initiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial
judgment. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that “the indictment
or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the
executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions” in violation of “the
constitutional separation of powers.”! Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the
Department of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. § 515;
28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC’s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising
prosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC’s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal
criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to
govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.?

Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted,
it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President’s term is permissible. The OLC
opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office.* And if
individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at
this time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in

 

! A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222,
222, 260 (2000) (OLC Op.).

? See U.S. CONST. Art. 1 § 2, cl. 5; § 3, cl. 6; ¢f OLC Op. at 257-258 (discussing relationship
between impeachment and criminal prosecution of a sitting President).

* OLC Op. at 257 n.36 (“A grand jury could continue to gather evidence throughout the period of
immunity”).

* OLC Op. at 255 (“Recognizing an immunity from prosecution for a sitting President would not
preclude such prosecution once the President’s term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by
resignation or impeachment™).

safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual
" investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary
materials were available.

Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice
Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply
an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. The
threshold step under the Justice Manual standards is to assess whether a person’s conduct
“constitutes a federal offense.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice
Manual). Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges
can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a
speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An
individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In
contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought,
affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.

The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case
of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor’s accusation of a crime, even in an internal report,
could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice. OLC noted similar
concerns about sealed indictments. Even if an indictment were sealed during the President’s term,
OLC reasoned, “it would be very difficult to preserve [an indictment’s] secrecy,” and if an
indictment became public, “[t]he stigma and opprobrium” could imperil the President’s ability to
govern.”8 Although a prosecutor’s internal report would not represent a formal public accusation
akin to an indictment, the possibility of the report’s public disclosure and the absence of a neutral
adjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially determining “that the
person’s conduct constitutes a federal offense.” Justice Manual § 9-27.220.

Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President
clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the
applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we
obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from
conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does
not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.

This report on our investigation consists of four parts. Section I provides an overview of
obstruction-of-justice principles and summarizes certain investigatory and evidentiary
considerations. Section II sets forth the factual results of our obstruction investigation and
analyzes the evidence. Section IIl addresses statutory and constitutional defenses. Section IV
states our conclusion.

conspirators in an indictment. See United States v. Briggs, 514 F.2d 794, 802 (5th Cir. 1975) (“The courts
have struck down with strong language efforts by grand juries to accuse persons of crime while affording

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME II

Our obstruction-of-justice inquiry focused on a series of actions by the President that
related to the Russian-interference investigations, including the President’s conduct towards the
law enforcement officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events.

FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION
The key issues and events we examined include the following:

The Campaign’s response to reports about Russian support for Trump. During the 2016
presidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government’s apparent support for
candidate Trump. Afier WikiLeaks released politically damaging Democratic Party emails that
were reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump publicly expressed skepticism that Russia
was responsible for the hacks at the same time that he and other Campaign officials privately
sought information about any further planned Wikileaks
releases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though as late
as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a skyscraper to be
built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow. After the election, the President expressed concerns
to advisors that reports of Russia’s election interference might lead the public to question the
legitimacy of his election.

Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn. In mid-January 2017,
incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President, other
administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak
about Russia’s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference. On January 27,
the day afier the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar
statements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White
House and told Comey that he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President
requested Flynn’s resignation, the President told an outside advisor, “Now that we fired Flynn, the
Russia thing is over.” The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would continue.

Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting
with Comey. Referring to the FBI’s investigation of Flynn, the President said, “I hope you can
see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. Thope you can let this
go.” Shortly after requesting Flynn’s resignation and speaking privately to Comey, the President
sought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating
that the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined
because she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel’s Office attorney
thought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered.

The President’s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation. In February 2017,
Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from campaign-
related investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign. In early March, the President
told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing. And after Sessions
announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors
that he should have an Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, the President
took Sessions aside at an event and urged him to “unrecuse.” Later in March, Comey publicly


==================== PAGE 217 ====================

 

disclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI was investigating “the Russian government’s
efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” including any links or coordination between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the President reached
out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel
the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.
The President also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid
direct contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously assured the President that
the FBI was not investigating him personally, and the President asked Comey to “lift the cloud”
of the Russia investigation by saying that publicly.

The President’s termination of Comey. On May 3, 2017, Comey testified in a
congressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether the President was
personally under investigation. Within days, the President decided to terminate Comey. The
President insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Comey
had informed the President that he was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White
House maintained that Comey’s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the
Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling
the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire Comey before
hearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing Comey, the President told Russian
officials that he had “faced great pressure because of Russia,” which had been “taken off” by
Comey’s firing. The next day, the President acknowledged in a television interview that he was
going to fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice’s recommendation and that when he
“decided to just do it,” he was thinking that “this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.”
In response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia investigation,
the President said, “As far as I’m concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly,”
adding that firing Comey “might even lengthen out the investigation.”

The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him. On May 17, 2017, the
Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conduct the
investigation and related matters. The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had been
appointed by telling advisors that it was “the end of his presidency” and demanding that Sessions
resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The
President told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special
Counsel therefore could not serve. The President’s advisors told him the asserted conflicts were
meritless and had already been considered by the Department of Justice.

On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel’s Office was investigating
whether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this “a major turning point” in
the investigation: while Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, following
Comey’s firing, the President now was under investigation. The President reacted to this news
with a series of tweets criticizing the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel’s
investigation. On June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call
the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be
removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather
than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.

Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel’s investigation. Two days after directing McGahn
to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of
the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with
his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and
dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should
publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation
was “very unfair” to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to
meet with the Special Counsel and “let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling
for future elections.” Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do.

One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the
President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel
investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message
would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an
interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that
Sessions’s job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President’s message
personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions.
Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.

Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence. In the summer of 2017, the President
learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower
between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was
said to be offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its
government’s support for Mr. Trump.” On several occasions, the President directed aides not to
publicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not
leak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the emails
became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that
acknowledged that the meeting was with “an individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have
information helpful to the campaign™ and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions
of Russian children. When the press asked questions about the President’s involvement in Trump
Jr.’s statement, the President’s personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any
role.

Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation. In early
summer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal
from the Russia investigation. Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In October 2017, the President
met privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him to “take [a] look™ at investigating
Clinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation
agreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes
taken by a senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia
investigation, he would be a “hero.” The President told Sessions, “I’m not going to do anything
or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.” In response, Sessions volunteered
that he had never seen anything “improper” on the campaign and told the President there was a
“whole new leadership team” in place. He did not unrecuse.

Efforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special
Counsel removed. Tn early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to


==================== PAGE 219 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Atterney-WorkProduet // May-Contain-Material-Proteeted-Under Fed-R—-Crim—P—6(e)

have the Special Counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather
than carry out the order. The President reacted to the news stories by directing White House
officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to
have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials that the media reports were
accurate in stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed.
The President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the
reports. In the same meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special
Counsel about the President’s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes
of his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered
happening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle.

Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort,m. After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense
agreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President’s personal
counsel left a message for Flynn’s attorneys reminding them of the President’s warm feelings
towards Flynn, which he said “still remains,” and asking for a “heads up” if Flynn knew
“information that implicates the President.” When Flynn’s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no
longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President’s personal counsel
said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn’s actions reflected “hostility” towards
the President. During Manafort’s prosecution and when the jury in his criminal trial was
deliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that Manafort was being treated
unfairly, and declined to rule out a pardon. After Manafort was convicted, the President called
Manafort “a brave man” for refusing to “break” and said that “flipping” “almost ought to be

outlawed.” REMURCReLTILT N EliCls

     

         

Conduct involving Michael Cohen. The President’s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a
former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized
the President’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when
he became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the
Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate
Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia
to advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the project,
including stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed
travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a “party line” that Cohen said was developed to
minimize the President’s connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony,
Cohen had extensive discussions with the President’s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen,
said that Cohen should “stay on message” and not contradict the President. After the FBI searched
Cohen’s home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not
“flip,” contacted him directly to tell him to “stay strong,” and privately passed messages of support
to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President’s personal counsel and believed that if
he stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the
government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a “rat,” and
suggested that his family members had committed crimes.

Overarching factual issues. We did not make a traditional prosecution decision about
these facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President’s
conduct.

Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-
justice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as
firing the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises
constitutional issues discussed below. At the same time, the President’s position as the head of
the Executive Branch provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official
proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses—all of which is relevant to a potential
obstruction-of-justice analysis. Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of
justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was
involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. Although the obstruction
statutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of
the President’s intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct. Third,
many of the President’s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with
the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That
circumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the
obstruction laws. Ifthe likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony,
the harm to the justice system’s integrity is the same.

Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of
the President’s conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President’s
acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the actions we investigated
can be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in the President’s motives. The first
phase covered the period from the President’s first interactions with Comey through the President’s
firing of Comey. During that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally
under investigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel,
however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an
obstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President engaged in a second phase of conduct,
involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both
public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about
the nature of the President’s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the
evidence.

STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES

The President’s counsel raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible
obstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of those
legal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts.

Statutory defenses. Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice’s general
approach to interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here.
See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c)(2) is an omnibus
obstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive acts directed at pending or
contemplated official proceedings. No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the
provision to cover only conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections
1503 and 1505 also offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury,

7


==================== PAGE 221 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Atterney—WoreProduet / May-Contain-Material Protected-Under Fed—R—Crim—P—6(e)

judicial, administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision
in Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or hinder the communication
to law enforcement of information related to a federal crime.

Constitutional defenses. As for constitutional defenses arising from the President’s status
as the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts
have not definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those issues through the
framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues. The
Department of Justice and the President’s personal counsel have recognized that the President is
subject to statutes that prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury
because that conduct does not implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the
President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the
Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his
authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.

Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and
permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers.
The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including
those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts regardless of their source. We also
concluded that any inroad on presidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts
does not undermine the President’s ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. The term
“corruptly” sets a demanding standard. It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an
intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty
and the rights of others. A preclusion of “corrupt” official action does not diminish the President’s
ability to exercise Article Il powers. For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not
demand freedom for the President to act with a corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal
punishment, avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary,
a statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers, rather than
hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law. It also aligns with the President’s
constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in
which a criminal investigation of the President’s conduct is justified, inquiries to determine
whether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance
of his constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction
laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional
system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.

CONCLUSION

Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw
ultimate conclusions about the President’s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were
making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a
thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,
we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach
that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a
crime, it also does not exonerate him.

I. BACKGROUND LEGAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRINCIPLES
A. Legal Framework of Obstruction of Justice

The May 17, 2017 Appointment Order and the Special Counsel regulations provide this
Office with jurisdiction to investigate “federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent
to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice,
destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). Because of that
description of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice investigation with
the elements of obstruction offenses in mind. Our evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the
elements of such offenses, although we do not draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that
govern a prosecutorial decision under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual
§ 9-27.000 et seq. (2018).

Here, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant obstruction
statutes in an ordinary case. This discussion does not address the unique constitutional issues that
arise in an inquiry into official acts by the President. Those issues are discussed in a later section
of this report addressing constitutional defenses that the President’s counsel have raised. See
Volume 11, Section II1.B, infra.

Three basic elements are common to most of the relevant obstruction statutes: (1) an
obstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt
intent. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(c)(2). We describe those elements as they have
been interpreted by the courts. We then discuss a more specific statute aimed at witness tampering,
see 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b), and describe the requirements for attempted offenses and endeavors to
obstruct justice, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1512(c)(2).

Obstructive act. Obstruction-of-justice law “reaches all corrupt conduct capable of
producing an effect that prevents justice from being duly administered, regardless of the means
employed.” United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (11th Cir. 1984) (interpreting 18
U.S.C. § 1503). An “effort to influence” a proceeding can qualify as an endeavor to obstruct
justice even if the effort was “subtle or circuitous” and “however cleverly or with whatever
cloaking of purpose” it was made. United States v. Roe, 529 F.2d 629, 632 (4th Cir. 1975); see
also United States v. Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir. 2006). The verbs “*obstruct or impede’
are broad” and “can refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult, or hinders.” Marinelio v. United
States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted).

An improper motive can render an actor’s conduct criminal even when the conduct would
otherwise be lawful and within the actor’s authority. See United States v. Cueto, 151 F.3d 620,
631 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming obstruction conviction of a criminal defense attorney for “litigation-
related conduct™); Unifed States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 992 (1st Cir. 1987) (“any act by any
party—whether lawful or unlawful on its face—may abridge § 1503 if performed with a corrupt
motive”).

Nexus to a pending or contemplated official proceeding. Obstruction-of-justice law
generally requires a nexus, or connection, to an official proceeding. In Section 1503, the nexus
must be to pending “judicial or grand jury proceedings.” United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593,


==================== PAGE 223 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

AttorreyWorke Produet // May-ContainMaterial Proteeted-UnderFedR—ECrim—P—6(e)

599 (1995). In Section 1505, the nexus can include a connection to a “pending” federal agency
proceeding or a congressional inquiry or investigation. Under both statutes, the government must
demonstrate “a relationship in time, causation, or logic” between the obstructive act and the
proceeding or inquiry to be obstructed. Id. at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States,
544 U.S. 696, 707-708 (2005). Section 1512(c) prohibits obstructive efforts aimed at official
proceedings including judicial or grand jury proceedings. 18 U.S.C. § 1515(a)(1)(A). “For
purposes of” Section 1512, “an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted
at the time of the offense.” 18 U.S.C. § 1512(f)(1). Although a proceeding need not already be in
progress to trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to a contemplated proceeding still must
be shown. United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781
F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009);
United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). The nexus requirement narrows the
scope of obstruction statutes to ensure that individuals have “fair warning” of what the law
proscribes. Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The nexus showing has subjective and objective components. As an objective matter, a
defendant must act “in a manner that is /ikely to obstruct justice,” such that the statute “excludes
defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably
be successful.” Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).
“[Tlhe endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due
administration of justice.” Id at 599 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As a
subjective matter, the actor must have “contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.”
Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445-446. A defendant need not directly impede the proceeding. Rather, a
nexus exists if “discretionary actions of a third person would be required to obstruct the judicial
proceeding if it was foreseeable to the defendant that the third party would act on the [defendant’s]
communication in such a way as to obstruct the judicial proceeding.” United States v. Martinez,
862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 2017) (brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).

Corruptly. The word “corruptly” provides the intent element for obstruction of justice and
means acting “knowingly and dishonestly” or “with an improper motive.” United States v.
Richardson, 676 F.3d 491, 508 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151
(10th Cir. 2013) (to act corruptly means to “act[] with an improper purpose and to engage in
conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, impede or obstruct” the
relevant proceeding) (some quotation marks omitted); see 18 U.S.C. § 1515(b) (“As used in section
1505, the term ‘corruptly’ means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing
another.”); see also Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (interpreting “corruptly” to mean
“wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil” and holding that acting “knowingly . . . corruptly” in 18
U.S.C. § 1512(b) requires “consciousness of wrongdoing”). The requisite showing is made when
a person acted with an intent to obtain an “improper advantage for [him]self or someone else,
inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.” BALLENTINE’S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d
ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Aguilar, 515 U.S. at
616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (characterizing this definition as the
“longstanding and well-accepted meaning” of “corruptly”).

Witness tampering. A more specific provision in Section 1512 prohibits tampering with a
witness. See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(1), (3) (making it a crime to “knowingly use[] intimidation . . .
or corruptly persuade[] another person,” or “engage[] in misleading conduct towards another

10

person,” with the intent to “influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official
proceeding” or to “hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer . . .
of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense”). To
establish corrupt persuasion, it is sufficient that the defendant asked a potential witness to lie to
investigators in contemplation of a likely federal investigation into his conduct. United States v.
Edlind, 887 F.3d 166, 174 (4th Cir. 2018); United States v. Sparks, 791 F.3d 1188, 1191-1192
(10th Cir. 2015); United Staies v. Byrne, 435 F.3d 16, 23-26 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.
LaShay, 417 F.3d 715, 718-719 (7th Cir. 2005); United States v. Burns, 298 F.3d 523, 539-540
(6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Pennington, 168 F.3d 1060, 1066 (8th Cir. 1999). The
“persuasion” need not be coercive, intimidating, or explicit; it is sufficient to “urge,” “induce,”
“ask[],” “argu[e],” “giv[e] reasons,” Sparks, 791 F.3d at 1192, or “coach[] or remind[] witnesses
by planting misleading facts,” Edlind, 887 F.3d at 174. Corrupt persuasion is shown “where a
defendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the story were true, intending that the witness
believe the story and testify to it.” United States v. Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. 1986); see
United States v. Gabriel, 125 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 1997). It also covers urging a witness to recall
a fact that the witness did not know, even if the fact was actually true. See LaShay, 417 F.3d at
719. Corrupt persuasion also can be shown in certain circumstances when a person, with an
improper motive, urges a witness not to cooperate with law enforcement. See United States v.
Shotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cr. 1998) (telling Secretary “not to [say] anything [to the FBI]
and [she] would not be bothered™).

When the charge is acting with the intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the communication
of information to law enforcement under Section 1512(b)(3), the “nexus” to a proceeding inquiry
articulated in Aguilar—that an individual have “knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the
judicial proceeding,” 515 U.S. at 599—does not apply because the obstructive act is aimed at the
communication of information to investigators, not at impeding an official proceeding.

Acting “knowingly . . . corruptly” requires proof that the individual was “conscious of
wrongdoing.” Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (declining to explore “[t]he outer limits of
this element” but indicating that an instruction was infirm where it permitted conviction even if
the defendant “honestly and sincerely believed that [the] conduct was lawful). It is an affirmative
defense that “the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendant’s sole intention
was to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.” 18 U.S.C. § 1512(e).

Attempts and endeavors. Section 1512(c)(2) covers both substantive obstruction offenses
and attempts to obstruct justice. Under general principles of attempt law, a person is guilty of an
attempt when he has the intent to commit a substantive offense and takes an overt act that
constitutes a substantial step towards that goal. See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S.
102, 106-107 (2007). “[T]he act [must be] substantial, in that it was strongly corroborative of the
defendant’s criminal purpose.” United States v. Pratt, 351 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 2003). While
“mere abstract talk” does not suffice, any “concrete and specific” acts that corroborate the
defendant’s intent can constitute a “substantial step.” United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d 1184, 1198-
1205 (10th Cir. 2011). Thus, “soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an
element of the crime” may qualify as a substantial step. Model Penal Code § 5.01(2)(g); see United
States v. Lucas, 499 F.3d 769, 781 (8th Cir. 2007).

The omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 prohibits an “endeavor” to obstruct justice, which
sweeps more broadly than Section 1512’s attempt provision. See United States v. Sampson, 898
F.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988)
(collecting cases). “It is well established that a[n] [obstruction-of-justice] offense is complete
when one corruptly endeavors to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice; the
prosecution need not prove that the due administration of justice was actually obstructed or
impeded.” United States v. Davis, 854 F.3d 1276, 1292 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks
omitted).

B. Investigative and Evidentiary .Considerations

After the appointment of the Special Counsel, this Office obtained evidence about the
following events relating to potential issues of obstruction of justice involving the President:

(a) The President’s January 27, 2017 dinner with former FBI Director James Comey in which
the President reportedly asked for Comey’s loyalty, one day after the White House had
been briefed by the Department of Justice on contacts between former National Security
Advisor Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador;

(b) The President’s February 14, 2017 meeting with Comey in which the President reportedly
asked Comey not to pursue an investigation of Flynn;

(¢) The President’s private requests to Comey to make public the fact that the President was
not the subject of an FBI investigation and to lift what the President regarded as a cloud,;

(d) The President’s outreach to the Director of National Intelligence and the Directors of the
National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency about the FBI’s Russia
investigation;

(¢) The President’s stated rationales for terminating Comey on May 9, 2017, including
statements that could reasonably be understood as acknowledging that the FBI’s Russia
investigation was a factor in Comey’s termination; and

() The President’s reported involvement in issuing a statement about the June 9, 2016 Trump
Tower meeting between Russians and senior Trump Campaign officials that said the
meeting was about adoption and omitted that the Russians had offered to provide the
Trump Campaign with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.

Taking into account that information and our analysis of applicable statutory and constitutional
principles (discussed below in Volume II, Section III, infra), we determined that there was a
sufficient factual and legal basis to further investigate potential obstruction-of-justice issues
involving the President.

Many of the core issues in an obstruction-of-justice investigation turn on an individual’s
actions and intent. We therefore requested that the White House provide us with documentary
evidence in its possession on the relevant events. We also sought and obtained the White House’s
concurrence in our conducting interviews of White House personnel who had relevant information.
And we interviewed other witnesses who had pertinent knowledge, obtained documents on a

12


==================== PAGE 226 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney-WerkProduet // May-Contain-Material-ProteetedUnderFed—R-Crim—P6(e)

voluntary basis when possible, and used legal process where appropriate. These investigative steps
allowed us to gather a substantial amount of evidence.

We also sought a voluntary interview with the President. After more than a year of
discussion, the President declined to be interviewed.

 
 
  

During the course of our discussions,
the President did agree to answer written questions on certain Russia-related topics, and he
provided us with answers. He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on
obstruction topics or questions on events during the transition. Ultimately, while we believed that
we had the authority and legal justification to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the President’s
testimony, we chose not to do so. We made that decision in view of the substantial delay that such
an investigative step would likely produce at a late stage in our investigation. We also assessed
that based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the President’s actions
and his public and private statements describing or explaining those actions, we had sufficient
evidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the President’s
testimony. The Office’s decision-making process on this issue is described in more detail in
Appendix C, infra, in a note that precedes the President’s written responses.

In assessing the evidence we obtained, we relied on common principles that apply in any
investigation. The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence. See,
e.g., United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (11th Cir. 2016) (“[G]uilty knowledge can
rarely be established by direct evidence. . . . Therefore, mens rea elements such as knowledge or
intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); United
States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 36 (2d Cir. 2012) (“The government’s case rested on
circumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of knowledge and intent can often be proved
through circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.”) (internal
quotation marks omitted). The principle that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence
is a necessity in criminal cases, given the right of a subject to assert his privilege against compelled
self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment and therefore decline to testify. Accordingly,
determinations on intent are frequently reached without the opportunity to interview an
investigatory subject.

Obstruction-of-justice cases are consistent with this rule. See, e.g., Edlind, 887 F.3d at
174, 176 (relying on “significant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] was conscious of her
wrongdoing” in an obstruction case; “[blecause evidence of intent will almost always be
circumstantial, a defendant may be found culpable where the reasonable and foreseeable
consequences of her acts are the obstruction of justice™) (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and
punctuation omitted); Quattrone, 441 F.3d at 173-174. Circumstantial evidence that illuminates
intent may include a pattern of potentially obstructive acts. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (“Evidence of a
crime, wrong, or other act . . . may be admissible . .. [to] prov[e] motive, opportunity, intent,
preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.”); see, e.g., United
States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648-650 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Arnold, 773 F.2d
823, 832-834 (7th Cir. 1985); Cintolo, 818 F.2d at 1000.

Credibility judgments may also be made based on objective facts and circumstantial
evidence. Standard jury instructions highlight a variety of factors that are often relevant in

13


==================== PAGE 227 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney-WerlcProduet // May-Ceontain-Material-Proteeted-Under Fed-R—Crim—P—6te)

assessing credibility. These include whether a witness had a reason not to tell the truth; whether
the witness had a good memory; whether the witness had the opportunity to observe the events
about which he testified; whether the witness’s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses;
and whether anything the witness said or wrote previously contradicts his testimony. See, e.g.,
First Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions § 1.06 (2018); Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions
(Criminal Cases) § 1.08 (2012); Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction § 3.01 (2012).

In addition to those general factors, we took into account more specific factors in assessing
the credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts. For example, contemporancous written notes
can provide strong corroborating evidence. See United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 232 (1975)
(the fact that a “statement appeared in the contemporaneously recorded report . . . would tend
strongly to corroborate the investigator’s version of the interview™). Similarly, a witness’s
recitation of his account before he had any motive to fabricate also supports the witness’s
credibility. See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 158 (1995) (“A consistent statement that
predates the motive is a square rebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived as a
consequence of that motive.”). Finally, a witness’s false description of an encounter can imply
consciousness of wrongdoing. See Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2010)
(noting the “well-settled principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence—often strong
evidence—of guilt”). We applied those settled legal principles in evaluating the factual results of
our investigation.

II. FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION

This section of the report details the evidence we obtained. We first provide an overview
of how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, and how candidate Trump
responded. We then turn to the key events that we investigated: the President’s conduct concerning
the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the President’s reaction to public confirmation of the FBI’s
Russia investigation; events leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Comey;
efforts to terminate the Special Counsel; efforts to curtail the scope of the Special Counsel’s
investigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower
meeting between Russians and senior campaign officials; efforts to have the Attorney General
unrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other witnesses.

We summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three statutory
obstruction-of-justice elements: obstructive act, nexus to a proceeding, and intent. We focus on
clements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel has “jurisdiction . . . to investigate . . . federal
crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel’s
investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of
witnesses.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). Consistent with our jurisdiction to investigate federal
obstruction crimes, we gathered evidence that is relevant to the elements of those crimes and
analyzed them within an elements framework—while refraining from reaching ultimate
conclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above. This section
also does not address legal and constitutional defenses raised by counsel for the President; those
defenses are analyzed in Volume I1, Section III, infra.

A. The Campaign’s Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump

During the 2016 campaign, the media raised questions about a possible connection between
the Trump Campaign and Russia.” The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically
damaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia. Trump
responded to questions about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement
in Russia—even though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late
as June 2016. Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same
time as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information w about any
further planned WikiLeaks releases. After the election, when questions persisted about possible
links between Russia and the Trump Campaign, the President-Elect continued to deny any
connections to Russia and privately expressed concerns that reports of Russian election
interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election.®

 

" This section summarizes and cites various news stories not for the truth of the information
contained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump’s response to those stories in context. Volume
I of this report analyzes the underlying facts of several relevant events that were reported on by the media
during the campaign.

% As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals
with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence
was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with
representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.

1. Press Reports Allege Links Between the Trump Campaign and Russia

On June 16, 2015, Donald J. Trump declared his intent to seek nomination as the
Republican candidate for President.” By early 2016, he distinguished himself among Republican
candidates by speaking of closer ties with Russia,'® saying he would get along well with Russian
President Vladimir Putin,'' questioning whether the NATO alliance was obsolete,'? and praising
Putin as a “strong leader.”’® The press reported that Russian political analysts and commentators
perceived Trump as favorable to Russia.'*

Beginning in February 2016 and continuing through the summer, the media reported that
several Trump campaign advisors appeared to have ties to Russia. For example, the press reported
that campaign advisor Michael Flynn was seated next to Vladimir Putin at an RT gala in Moscow
in December 2015 and that Flynn had appeared regularly on RT as an analyst.'”” The press also
reported that foreign policy advisor Carter Page had ties to a Russian state-run gas company,'® and
that campaign chairman Paul Manafort had done work for the “Russian-backed former Ukrainian
president Viktor Yanukovych.”!” In addition, the press raised questions during the Republican

On June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm that had conducted in-house analysis for the
Democratic National Committee (DNC) posted an announcement that Russian government
hackers had infiltrated the DNC’s computer and obtained access to documents."

On July 22, 2016, the day before the Democratic National Convention, WikiL.eaks posted
thousands of hacked DNC documents revealing sensitive internal deliberations.?® Soon thereafter,
Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager publicly contended that Russia had hacked the DNC emails
and arranged their release in order to help candidate Trump.2! On July 26, 2016, the New York
Times reported that U.S. “intelligence agencies ha[d] told the White House they now have ‘high
confidence’ that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the
Democratic National Committee.”?

Within the Trump Campaign, aides reacted with enthusiasm to reports of the hacks.?
discussed with Campaign officials that WikiLeaks
would release the hacked material.” Some witnesses said that Trump himself discussed the

In the days that followed Wikil.eaks’s July 22, 2016 release of hacked DNC emails, the
Trump Campaign publicly rejected suggestions that Russia was seeking to aid candidate Trump.
On July 26, 2016, Trump tweeted that it was “[c]razy” to suggest that Russia was “dealing with
Trump™? and that “[f]or the record,” he had “ZERO investments in Russia.”**

In a press conference the next day, July 27, 2016, Trump characterized “this whole thing
with Russia” as “a total deflection” and stated that it was “farfetched” and “ridiculous.”** Trump
said that the assertion that Russia had hacked the emails was unproven, but stated that it would
give him “no pause” if Russia had Clinton’s emails.>> Trump added, “Russia, if you’re listening,
I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded

do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now,” and in response to a
question about whether he would recognize Crimea as Russian territory and consider lifting
sanctions, Trump replied, “We’ll be looking at that. Yeah, we’ll be looking.”’

During the press conference, Trump repeated “I have nothing to do with Russia” five
times.?® He stated that “the closest [he] came to Russia” was that Russians may have purchased a
home or condos from him.*® He said that after he held the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in
2013 he had been interested in working with Russian companies that “wanted to put a lot of money
into developments in Russia” but “it never worked out.”*® He explained, “[f]rankly, T didn’t want
to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer . . . that wanted to develop
property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.”*' The Trump Organization,
however, had been pursuing a building project in Moscow—the Trump Tower Moscow project—
from approximately September 2015 through June 2016, and the candidate was regularly updated

by Trump himself to finalize it.**

advisors had developed a “party line” that Trump had no business with Russia and no connections
to Russia.*®

In addition to denying any connections with Russia, the Trump Campaign reacted to reports
of Russian election interference in aid of the Campaign by seeking to distance itself from Russian
contacts. For example, in August 2016, foreign policy advisor J.D. Gordon declined an invitation
to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s residence because the timing was “not optimal” in view
of media reports about Russian interference.*® On August 19, 2016, Manafort was asked to resign
amid media coverage scrutinizing his ties to a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and links to
Russian business.*” And when the media published stories about Page’s connections to Russia in
September 2016, Trump Campaign officials terminated Page’s association with the Campaign and
told the press that he had played “no role” in the Campaign.*®

On October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks released the first set of emails stolen by a Russian
intelligence agency from Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta.”” The same day, the federal
government announced that “the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails
from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.”*® The government
statement directly linked Russian hacking to the releases on Wikil.eaks, with the goal of interfering
with the presidential election, and concluded “that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have
authorized these activities” based on their “scope and sensitivity.”*!

On October 11, 2016, Podesta stated publicly that the FBI was investigating Russia’s
hacking and said that candidate Trump might have known in advance that the hacked emails were
going to be released.’? Vice Presidential Candidate Mike Pence was asked whether the Trump

On November 8, 2016, Trump was elected President. Two days later, Russian officials
told the press that the Russian government had maintained contacts with Trump’s “immediate
entourage” during the campaign.®® In response, Hope Hicks, who had been the Trump Campaign
spokesperson, said, “We are not aware of any campaign representatives that were in touch with
any foreign entities before yesterday, when Mr. Trump spoke with many world leaders.” Hicks
gave an additional statement denying any contacts between the Campaign and Russia: “It never
happened. There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the
campaign.”®

On December 10, 2016, the press reported that U.S. intelligence agencies had “concluded
that Russia interfered in last month’s presidential election to boost Donald Trump’s bid for the
White House.””” Reacting to the story the next day, President-Elect Trump stated, “T think it’s
ridiculous. I think it’s just another excuse.”® He continued that no one really knew who was
responsible for the hacking, suggesting that the intelligence community had “no idea if it’s Russia
or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place.”® The President-Elect

suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics.”*

On December 18, 2016, Podesta told the press that the election was “distorted by the
Russian intervention” and questioned whether Trump Campaign officials had been “in touch with
the Russians.”®! The same day, incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appeared on Fox News
Sunday and declined to say whether the President-Elect accepted the intelligence community’s
determination that Russia intervened in the election.’ When asked about any contact or
coordination between the Campaign and Russia, Priebus said, “Even this question is insane. Of

government had developed a clear preference for Trump.”

Several days later, BuzzFeed published unverified allegations compiled by former British
intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the campaign about candidate Trump’s Russia
connections under the headline “These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties To Russia.”™”' In a
press conference the next day, the President-Elect called the release “an absolute disgrace” and
said, “I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve
stayed away. ... SoT have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals
in Russia very easily if we wanted to, T just don’t want to because I think that would be a conflict.””?

Several advisors recalled that the President-Elect viewed stories about his Russian
connections, the Russia investigations, and the intelligence community assessment of Russian
interference as a threat to the legitimacy of his electoral victory.” Hicks, for example, said that
the President-Elect viewed the intelligence community assessment as his “Achilles heel” because,
even if Russia had no impact on the election, people would think Russia helped him win, taking
away from what he had accomplished.” Sean Spicer, the first White House communications
director, recalled that the President thought the Russia story was developed to undermine the
legitimacy of his election.”” Gates said the President viewed the Russia investigation as an attack
on the legitimacy of his win.”® And Priebus recalled that when the intelligence assessment came

B. The President’s Conduct Concerning the Investigation of Michael Flynn
Overview

During the presidential transition, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had
two phone calls with the Russian Ambassador to the United States about the Russian response to
U.S. sanctions imposed because of Russia’s election interference. After the press reported on
Flynn’s contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Flynn lied to incoming Administration officials
by saying he had not discussed sanctions on the calls. The officials publicly repeated those lies in
press interviews. The FBI, which previously was investigating Flynn for other matters,
interviewed him about the calls in the first week after the inauguration, and Flynn told similar lies
to the FBI. On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House
that Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been
interviewed by the FBI. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James
Comey in which he asked for Comey’s loyalty. On February 13,2017, the President asked Flynn
to resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Comey in which
he said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.”

Administration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian
individuals and entities.*® That day, multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the
sanctions and the impact they would have on the incoming Administration, and Flynn informed
members of the PTT that he would be speaking to the Russian Ambassador later in the day.*

Flynn, who was in the Dominican Republic at the time, and K.T. McFarland, who was slated to
become the Deputy National Security Advisor and was at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with
the President-Elect and other senior staff, talked by phone about what, if anything, Flynn should
communicate to Kislyak about the sanctions.®? McFarland had spoken with incoming
Administration officials about the sanctions and Russia’s possible responses and thought she had
mentioned in those conversations that Flynn was scheduled to speak with Kislyak.** Based on
those conversations, McFarland informed Flynn that incoming Administration officials at Mar-a-
Lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation.® At 4:43 p.m. that afternoon, McFarland sent
an email to several officials about the sanctions and informed the group that “Gen [F]lynn is talking
to russian ambassador this evening.”®

Approximately one hour later, McFarland met with the President-Elect and senior officials
and briefed them on the sanctions and Russia’s possible responses.®® Incoming Chief of Staff
Reince Priebus recalled that McFarland may have mentioned at the meeting that the sanctions
situation could be “cooled down” and not escalated.*” McFarland recalled that at the end of the
meeting, someone may have mentioned to the President-Elect that Flynn was speaking to the
Russian Ambassador that evening.®® McFarland did not recall any response by the President-
Elect.*® Priebus recalled that the President-Elect viewed the sanctions as an attempt by the Obama
Administration to embarrass him by delegitimizing his election.”

Immediately after discussing the sanctions with McFarland on December 29, 2016, Flynn
called Kislyak and requested that Russia respond to the sanctions only in a reciprocal manner,
without escalating the situation.”! After the call, Flynn briefed McFarland on its substance.”
Flynn told McFarland that the Russian response to the sanctions was not going to be escalatory
because Russia wanted a good relationship with the Trump Administration.”® On December 30,
2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures

3. Flynn Makes False Statements About his Communications with Kislyak to
Incoming Administration Officials, the Media, and the FBI

 

On January 12, 2017, a Washington Post columnist reported that Flynn and Kislyak
communicated on the day the Obama Administration announced the Russia sanctions.'”> The
column questioned whether Flynn had said something to “undercut the U.S. sanctions” and
whether Flynn’s communications had violated the letter or spirit of the Logan Act.'®

President-Elect Trump called Priebus after the story was published and expressed anger
about it.'>* Priebus recalled that the President-Elect asked, “What the hell is this all about?”'%
Priebus called Flynn and told him that the President-Elect was angry about the reporting on Flynn’s
conversations with Kislyak.'?® Flynn recalled that he felt a lot of pressure because Priebus had
spoken to the “boss” and said Flynn needed to “kill the story.”'*” Flynn directed McFarland to
call the Washington Post columnist and inform him that no discussion of sanctions had occurred.'*®
McFarland recalled that Flynn said words to the effect of, “I want to kill the story.”'?® McFarland
made the call as Flynn had requested although she knew she was providing false information, and
the Washington Post updated the column to reflect that a “Trump official” had denied that Flynn
and Kislyak discussed sanctions.'3

When Priebus and other incoming Administration officials questioned Flynn internally
about the Washington Post column, Flynn maintained that he had not discussed sanctions with
Kislyak."3! Flynn repeated that claim to Vice President-Elect Michael Pence and to incoming press
secretary Sean Spicer.'’? In subsequent media interviews in mid-January, Pence, Priebus, and

Spicer denied that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions, basing those denials on their
conversations with Flynn.'*?

The public statements of incoming Administration officials denying that Flynn and Kislyak
had discussed sanctions alarmed senior DOJ officials, who were aware that the statements were
not true.'** Those officials were concerned that Flynn had lied to his colleagues—who in turn had
unwittingly misled the American public—creating a compromise situation for Flynn because the
Department of Justice assessed that the Russian government could prove Flynn lied.'"*> The FBI
investigative team also believed that Flynn’s calls with Kislyak and subsequent denials about
discussing sanctions raised potential Logan Act issues and were relevant to the FBI's broader
Russia investigation.'*

On January 20, 2017, President Trump was inaugurated and Flynn was sworn in as
National Security Advisor. On January 23,2017, Spicer delivered his first press briefing and stated
that he had spoken with Flynn the night before, who confirmed that the calls with Kislyak were
about topics unrelated to sanctions.!*” Spicer’s statements added to the Department of Justice’s
concerns that Russia had leverage over Flynn based on his lies and could use that derogatory
information to compromise him.'*®

On January 24, 2017, Flynn agreed to be interviewed by agents from the FBL."** During
the interview, which took place at the White House, Flynn falsely stated that he did not ask Kislyak
to refrain from escalating the situation in response to the sanctions on Russia imposed by the
Obama Administration.'*® Flynn also falsely stated that he did not remember a follow-up
conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those
sanctions as a result of Flynn’s request.'*!

4. DOIJ Officials Notify the White House of Their Concerns About Flynn

On January 26, 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House Counsel
Donald McGahn and informed him that she needed to discuss a sensitive matter with him in
person.'*? Later that day, Yates and Mary McCord, a senior national security official at the
Department of Justice, met at the White House with McGahn and White House Counsel’s Office
attorney James Burnham.'® Yates said that the public statements made by the Vice President
denying that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions were not true and put Flynn in a potentially
compromised position because the Russians would know he had lied."** Yates disclosed that Flynn
had been interviewed by the FBL'* She declined to answer a specific question about how Flynn
had performed during that interview,'*® but she indicated that Flynn’s statements to the FBI were
similar to the statements he had made to Pence and Spicer denying that he had discussed
sanctions."*” McGahn came away from the meeting with the impression that the FBI had not
pinned Flynn down in lies,*® but he asked John Eisenberg, who served as legal advisor to the
National Security Council, to examine potential legal issues raised by Flynn’s FBI interview and
his contacts with Kislyak. 149

That afternoon, McGahn notified the President that Yates had come to the White House to
discuss concerns about Flynn."*® McGahn described what Yates had told him, and the President
asked him to repeat it, so he did."*' McGahn recalled that when he described the FBI interview of
Flynn, he said that Flynn did not disclose having discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but that there
may not have been a clear violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001."°? The President asked about Section
1001, and McGahn explained the law to him, and also explained the Logan Act.'*®> The President

instructed McGahn to work with Priebus and Bannon to look into the matter further and directed
that they not discuss it with any other officials.'** Priebus recalled that the President was angry
with Flynn in light of what Yates had told the White House and said, “not again, this guy, this
stuff,»15

That evening, the President dined with several senior advisors and asked the group what
they thought about FBI Director Comey.'*® According to Director of National Intelligence Dan
Coats, who was at the dinner, no one openly advocated terminating Comey but the consensus on
him was not positive.'”” Coats told the group that he thought Comey was a good director.”® Coats
encouraged the President to meet Comey face-to-face and spend time with him before making a
decision about whether to retain him.'*

5. McGahn has a Follow-Up Meeting About Flynn with Yates; President Trump
has Dinner with FBI Director Comey

The next day, January 27, 2017, McGahn and Eisenberg discussed the results of
Eisenberg’s initial legal research into Flynn’s conduct, and specifically whether Flynn may have
violated the Espionage Act, the Logan Act, or 18 U.S.C. § 1001."° Based on his preliminary
research, Eisenberg informed McGahn that there was a possibility that Flynn had violated 18
U.S.C. § 1001 and the Logan Act.'®! Eisenberg noted that the United States had never successfully
prosecuted an individual under the Logan Act and that Flynn could have possible defenses, and

that the President had become unhappy with Flynn even before the story of his calls with Kislyak broke
and had become so upset with Flynn that he would not look at him during intelligence briefings. Priebus
1/18/18 302, at 8. Hicks said that the President thought Flynn had bad judgment and was angered by tweets

under the circumstances.'®?

That same morning, McGahn asked Yates to return to the White House to discuss Flynn
again.'® In that second meeting, McGahn expressed doubts that the Department of Justice would
bring a Logan Act prosecution against Flynn, but stated that the White House did not want to take
action that would interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation of Flynn.'** Yates responded that
Department of Justice had notified the White House so that it could take action in response to the
information provided.!® McGahn ended the meeting by asking Yates for access to the underlying
information the Department of Justice possessed pertaining to Flynn’s discussions with Kislyak.'®®

Also on January 27, the President called FBI Director Comey and invited him to dinner
that evening.'®” Priebus recalled that before the dinner, he told the President something like, “don’t
talk about Russia, whatever you do,” and the President promised he would not talk about Russia
at the dinner.'®® McGahn had previously advised the President that he should not communicate
directly with the Department of Justice to avoid the perception or reality of political interference
in law enforcement.'® When Bannon learned about the President’s planned dinner with Comey,

Comey provided an account of the dinner in a contemporaneous memo, an interview with
this Office, and congressional testimony. According to Comey’s account of the dinner, the
President repeatedly brought up Comey’s future, asking whether he wanted to stay on as FBI
director.'” Because the President had previously said he wanted Comey to stay on as FBI director,
Comey interpreted the President’s comments as an effort to create a patronage relationship by
having Comey ask for his job.'” The President also brought up the Steele reporting that Comey
had raised in the January 6, 2017 briefing and stated that he was thinking about ordering the FBI
to investigate the allegations to prove they were false.'” Comey responded that the President
should think carefully about issuing such an order because it could create a narrative that the FBI
was investigating him personally, which was incorrect.!” Later in the dinner, the President
brought up Flynn and said, “the guy has serious judgment issues.”'”® Comey did not comment on
Flynn and the President did not acknowledge any FBI interest in or contact with Flynn.'”’

calls with Kislyak.'® Eisenberg recalled that he prepared a memorandum about criminal statutes
that could apply to Flynn’s conduct, but he did not believe the White House had enough
information to make a definitive recommendation to the President.'”® Eisenberg and McGahn
discussed that Eisenberg’s review of the underlying information confirmed his preliminary
conclusion that Flynn was unlikely to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act.'”' Because White
House officials were uncertain what Flynn had told the FBI, however, they could not assess his
exposure to prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001.'%

The week of February 6, Flynn had a one-on-one conversation with the President in the
Oval Office about the negative media coverage of his contacts with Kislyak.'”® Flynn recalled that
the President was upset and asked him for information on the conversations.'™ Flynn listed the
specific dates on which he remembered speaking with Kislyak, but the President corrected one of
the dates he listed.!”® The President asked Flynn what he and Kislyak discussed and Flynn

2017, that the FBI was not investigating the President personally. On May 8, 2017, during White House

they reviewed it, recalled the officials asking him whether Flynn’s conduct violated the Logan
Act.? McCabe responded that he did not know, but the FBI was investigating the matter because
it was a possibility.?”! Based on the evidence of Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak, McGahn and
Priebus concluded that Flynn could not have forgotten the details of the discussions of sanctions
and had instead been lying about what he discussed with Kislyak.”® Flynn had also told White
House officials that the FBI had told him that the FBI was closing out its investigation of him,**

with Flynn was one of trust.?'> Spicer told the press the next day that Flynn was forced to resign

here on Valentine’s Day 2018 talking about this.”?'® The President said, “[w]hat do you mean?
Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over.”" Christie recalled
responding that based on his experience both as a prosecutor and as someone who had been
investigated, firing Flynn would not end the investigation.””® Christic said there was no way to
make an investigation shorter, but a lot of ways to make it longer.”*' The President asked Christie
what he meant, and Christie told the President not to talk about the investigation even if he was

historic proportion!”?®¢ 1In late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a
message to Flynn telling him the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong.’

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s conduct related to the Flynn investigation, the following
evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive act. According to Comey’s account of his February 14, 2017 meeting
in the Oval Office, the President told him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to
letting Flynn go. . .. I hope you can let this go.” In analyzing whether these statements constitute
an obstructive act, a threshold question is whether Comey’s account of the interaction is accurate,
and, if so, whether the President’s statements had the tendency to impede the administration of
justice by shutting down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal
charge.

After Comey’s account of the President’s request to “let[] Flynn go” became public, the
President publicly disputed several aspects of the story. The President told the New York Times
that he did not “shoo other people out of the room” when he talked to Comey and that he did not
remember having a one-on-one conversation with Comey.”®® The President also publicly denied
that he had asked Comey to “let[] Flynn go™ or otherwise communicated that Comey should drop
the investigation of Flynn.?®® In private, the President denied aspects of Comey’s account to White
House advisors, but acknowledged to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Comey
and stated that Flynn was a good guy.?’® Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates
Comey’s account.

9 In a statement on May 16, 2017, the White House said: “While the President has repeatedly
expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President
has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving
General Flynn. . .. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President

First, Comey wrote a detailed memorandum of his encounter with the President on the
same day it occurred. Comey also told senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President
that day, and their recollections of what Comey told them at the time are consistent with Comey’s
account.?”!

Second, Comey provided testimony about the President’s request that he “let[] Flynn go”
under oath in congressional proceedings and in interviews with federal investigators subject to
penalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Comey’s recollections of the encounter have remained
consistent over time. '

Third, the objective, corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting came to
occur support Comey’s description of the event. Comey recalled that the President cleared the
room to speak with Comey alone after a homeland security briefing in the Oval Office, that
Kushner and Sessions lingered and had to be shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly
opened the door during the meeting, prompting the President to wave him away. While the
President has publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have
confirmed Comey’s account of how he ended up in a one-on-one meeting with the President.””?
And the President acknowledged to Priebus and McGahn that he in fact spoke to Comey about
Flynn in their one-on-one meeting.

Fourth, the President’s decision to clear the room and, in particular, to exclude the Attorney
General from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with Comey, which is
consistent with the delivery of a message of the type that Comey recalls, rather than a more
innocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the Attorney General.

Finally, Comey’s reaction to the President’s statements is consistent with the President
having asked him to “let[] Flynn go.” Comey met with the FBI leadership team, which agreed to
keep the President’s statements closely held and not to inform the team working on the Flynn
investigation so that they would not be influenced by the President’s request. Comey also promptly
met with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left alone with the President again, an account
verified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney
General’s chief of staff.

A second question is whether the President’s statements, which were not phrased as a direct
order to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI’s investigation of Flynn. While the
President said he “hope[d]” Comey could “let[] Flynn go,” rather than affirmatively directing him
to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Comey to close
the FBI’s investigation into Flynn. First, the President arranged the meeting with Comey so that
they would be alone and purposely excluded the Attorney General, which suggests that the
President meant to make a request to Comey that he did not want anyone else to hear. Second,
because the President is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he “hopes” a
subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the
President wants. Indeed, the President repeated a version of “let this go” three times, and Comey

testified that he understood the President’s statements as a directive, which is corroborated by the
way Comey reacted at the time.

b. Nexus to a proceeding. To establish a nexus to a proceeding, it would be necessary
to show that the President could reasonably foresee and actually contemplated that the
investigation of Flynn was likely to lead to a grand jury investigation or prosecution.

At the time of the President’s one-on-one meeting with Comey, no grand jury subpoenas
had been issued as part of the FBI’s investigation into Flynn. But Flynn’s lies to the FBI violated
federal criminal law, , and resulted in Flynn’s
prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001. By the time the President spoke to Comey about
Flynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn, who informed the President, that Flynn’s statements
to senior White House officials about his contacts with Kislyak were not true and that Flynn had
told the same version of events to the FBI. McGahn also informed the President that Flynn’s
conduct could violate 18 U.S.C. § 1001. After the Vice President and senior White House officials
reviewed the underlying information about Flynn’s calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that
Flynn could not have forgotten his conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been
lying. In addition, the President’s instruction to the FBI Director to “let[] Flynn go” suggests his
awareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of prosecution.

C. Intent. As part of our investigation, we examined whether the President had a
personal stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flynn—for example, whether the President
was aware of Flynn’s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred, such that
the President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that those lies had been
passed on to the public. Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and
content of Flynn’s calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be
relied upon to establish the President’s knowledge. In advance of Flynn’s initial call with Kislyak,
the President attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have
mentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak. Flynn told McFarland about the substance
of his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a difference in Russia’s response, and Flynn
recalled talking to Bannon in early January 2017 about how they had successfully “stopped the
train on Russia’s response” to the sanctions. Tt would have been reasonable for Flynn to have
wanted the President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn his
request had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate
in response to the request, and the President was pleased by the Russian response, calling it a
“[g]reat move.” And the President never said publicly or internally that Flynn had lied to him
about the calls with Kislyak.

But McFarland did not recall providing the President-Elect with Flynn’s read-out of his
calls with Kislyak, and Flynn does not have a specific recollection of telling the President-Elect
directly about the calls. Bannon also said he did not recall hearing about the calls from Flynn.
And in February 2017, the President asked Flynn what was discussed on the calls and whether he
had lied to the Vice President, suggesting that he did not already know. Our investigation
accordingly did not produce evidence that established that the President knew about Flynn’s
discussions of sanctions before the Department of Justice notified the White House of those
discussions in late January 2017. The evidence also does not establish that Flynn otherwise

46


==================== PAGE 260 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WeotkProduet // Meay-Contain-Material- Proteeted-UnderFed—R—CrimP-6(e)

possessed information damaging to the President that would give the President a personal incentive
to end the FBI’s inquiry into Flynn’s conduct.

Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI’s
broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that terminating Flynn would
end “the whole Russia thing.” Flynn’s firing occurred at a time when the media and Congress
were raising questions about Russia’s interference in the election and whether members of the
President’s campaign had colluded with Russia. Multiple witnesses recalled that the President
viewed the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election. The President
paid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with annoyance and anger when
the story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Just hours before
mecting one-on-one with Comey, the President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to
the Russia inquiries. And after Christie pushed back, telling the President that firing Flynn would
not end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach out to Comey and convey
that the President liked him and he was part of “the team.” That afternoon, the President cleared
the room and asked Comey to “let[] Flynn go.”

We also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President’s direction to Comey
was motivated by sympathy towards Flynn. In public statements the President repeatedly
described Flynn as a good person who had been harmed by the Russia investigation, and the
President directed advisors to reach out to Flynn to tell him the President “care[d]”
about him and felt bad for him. At the same time, multiple senior advisors, including Bannon,
Priebus, and Hicks, said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was
forced to resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn. Priebus said he believed
the President’s initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal regard, but from concern
about the negative press that would be generated by firing the National Security Advisor so early
in the Administration. And Priebus indicated that the President’s post-firing expressions of
support for Flynn were motivated by the President’s desire to keep Flynn from saying negative
things about him.

The way in which the President communicated the request to Comey also is relevant to
understanding the President’s intent. When the President first learned about the FBI investigation
into Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter with anyone else in the
White House. The next day, the President invited Comey for a one-on-one dinner against the
advice of an aide who recommended that other White House officials also attend. At the dinner,
the President asked Comey for “loyalty” and, at a different point in the conversation, mentioned
that Flynn had judgment issues. When the President met with Comey the day after Flynn’s
termination—shortly after being told by Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia
investigation—the President cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General, so that he
could again speak to Comey alone. The President’s decision to meet one-on-one with Comey
contravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not communicate
directly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of interfering in law enforcement
activities. And the President later denied that he cleared the room and asked Comey to “let[] Flynn
go”—a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise
of prosecutorial discretion.

Finally, the President’s effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that the
President had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the President’s concern
about being associated with Flynn’s conduct. The evidence does not establish that the President
was trying to have McFarland lie. The President’s request, however, was sufficiently irregular
that McFarland—who did not know the full extent of Flynn’s communications with the President
and thus could not make the representation the President wanted—felt the need to draft an internal
memorandum documenting the President’s request, and Eisenberg was concerned that the request
would look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an ambassadorship.

C. The President’s Reaction to Public Confirmation of the FBI’s Russia
Investigation

Overview

In early March 2017, the President learned that Sessions was considering recusing from
the Russia investigation and tried to prevent the recusal. After Sessions announced his recusal on
March 2, the President expressed anger at Sessions for the decision and then privately asked
Sessions to “unrecuse.” On March 20, 2017, Comey publicly disclosed the existence of the FBI’s
Russia investigation. In the days that followed, the President contacted Comey and other
intelligence agency leaders and asked them to push back publicly on the suggestion that the
President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort in order to “lift the cloud”
of the ongoing investigation.

Sessions should recuse from the Russia investigation based on his role in the 2016 Trump
Campaign.””® On March 1, 2017, the press reported that, in his January confirmation hearing to
become Attorney General, Senator Sessions had not disclosed two meetings he had with Russian
Ambassador Kislyak before the presidential election, leading to congressional calls for Sessions
to recuse or for a special counsel to investigate Russia’s interference in the presidential election.”’

Also on March 1, the President called Comey and said he wanted to check in and see how
Comey was doing.?”> According to an email Comey sent to his chief of staff after the call, the
President “talked about Sessions a bit,” said that he had heard Comey was “doing great,” and said
that he hoped Comey would come by to say hello when he was at the White House.”’”® Comey

interpreted the call as an effort by the President to “pull [him] in,” but he did not perceive the call
as an attempt by the President to find out what Comey was doing with the Flynn investigation.*”’

The next morning, the President called McGahn and urged him to contact Sessions to tell
him not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.?’® McGahn understood the President to
be concerned that a recusal would make Sessions look guilty for omitting details in his
confirmation hearing; leave the President unprotected from an investigation that could hobble the
presidency and derail his policy objectives; and detract from favorable press coverage of a
Presidential Address to Congress the President had delivered earlier in the week.”” McGahn
reached out to Sessions and reported that the President was not happy about the possibility of
recusal. 2 Sessions replied that he intended to follow the rules on recusal.”' McGahn reported
back to the President about the call with Sessions, and the President reiterated that he did not want
Sessions to recuse.?®? Throughout the day, McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to
avert Sessions’s recusal by speaking to Sessions’s personal counsel, Sessions’s chief of staff, and
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more times.*
Sessions recalled that other White House advisors also called him that day to argue against his
recusal 28

is not clear whether the President knew at that time of the FBI’s recent request concerning Flynn.>%

2. FBI Director Comey Publicly Confirms the Existence of the Russia
Investigation in Testimony Before HPSCI

On March 9, 2017, Comey briefed the “Gang of Eight” congressional leaders about the
FBI’s investigation of Russian interference, including an identification of the principal U.S.
subjects of the investigation.”” Although it is unclear whether the President knew of that briefing
at the time, notes taken by Annie Donaldson, then McGahn’s chief of staff, on March 12, 2017,
state, “POTUS in panic/chaos . . . Need binders to put in front of POTUS. (1) All things related
to Russia.”®® The week after Comey’s briefing, the White House Counsel’s Office was in contact
with SSCI Chairman Senator Richard Burr about the Russia investigations and appears to have
received information about the status of the FBI investigation.*®

On March 20, 2017, Comey was scheduled to testify before HPSCL*'® In advance of
Comey’s testimony, congressional officials made clear that they wanted Comey to provide
information about the ongoing FBI investigation.?'' Dana Boente, who at that time was the Acting
Attorney General for the Russia investigation, authorized Comey to confirm the existence of the
Russia investigation and agreed that Comey should decline to comment on whether any particular
individuals, including the President, were being investigated.*'?

were identified in notes taken by Donaldson as “Flynn (FBI was in—wrapping up)—DOJ looking for phone
records”; “Comey—Manafort (Ukr + Russia, not campaign)”; “Carter Page ($
game)”’; and “Greek Guy” (potentially referring to George Papadopoulos, later charged with violating 18

FBI for Comey’s briefing to the Gang of 8 on March 9. See SNS-Classified-0000140-44 (3/8/17 Email,

In his opening remarks at the HPSCI hearing, which were drafted in consultation with the
Department of Justice, Comey stated that he had “been authorized by the Department of Justice to
confirm that the FBI, as part of [its] counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian
government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating
the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian
government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.
As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any
crimes were committed.”'* Comey added that he would not comment further on what the FBI
was “doing and whose conduct [it] [was] examining” because the investigation was ongoing and
classified—but he observed that he had “taken the extraordinary step in consultation with the
Department of Justice of briefing this Congress’s leaders . . . in a classified setting in detail about
the investigation.”'* Comey was specifically asked whether President Trump was “under
investigation during the campaign” or “under investigation now.”'"> Comey declined to answer,
stating, “Please don’t over interpret what I’ve said as—as the chair and ranking know, we have
briefed him in great detail on the subjects of the investigation and what we’re doing, but I’'m not
gonna answer about anybody in this forum.”?'® Comey was also asked whether the FBI was
investigating the information contained in the Steele reporting, and he declined to answer.*"?

According to McGahn and Donaldson, the President had expressed frustration with Comey
before his March 20 testimony, and the testimony made matters worse.>'®* The President had
previously criticized Comey for too frequently making headlines and for not attending intelligence
briefings at the White House, and the President suspected Comey of leaking certain information
to the media.*'® McGahn said the President thought Comey was acting like “his own branch of
government.”??

Press reports following Comey’s March 20 testimony suggested that the FBI was
investigating the President, contrary to what Comey had told the President at the end of'the January
6, 2017 intelligence assessment briefing.**! McGahn, Donaldson, and senior advisor Stephen
Miller recalled that the President was upset with Comey’s testimony and the press coverage that
followed because of the suggestion that the President was under investigation.”* Notes from the
White House Counsel’s Office dated March 21, 2017, indicate that the President was “beside
himself” over Comey’s testimony.’?® The President called McGahn repeatedly that day to ask him
to intervene with the Department of Justice, and, according to the notes, the President was “getting
hotter and hotter, get rid?”3?* Officials in the White House Counsel’s Office became so concerned
that the President would fire Comey that they began drafting a memorandum that examined
whether the President needed cause to terminate the FBI director.’”

seek Boente’s assistance in having Comey or the Department of Justice correct the misperception
that the President was under investigation.’?® Boente did not specifically recall the conversations,

3. The President Asks Intellience Community Leaders to Make Public
Statements that he had No Connection to Russia

In the weeks following Comey’s March 20, 2017 testimony, the President repeatedly asked
intelligence community officials to push back publicly on any suggestion that the President had a
connection to the Russian election-interference effort.

On March 22, 2017, the President asked Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and
CIA Director Michael Pompeo to stay behind in the Oval Office after a Presidential Daily
Briefing.3** According to Coats, the President asked them whether they could say publicly that no
link existed between him and Russia.>*> Coats responded that the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI) has nothing to do with investigations and it was not his role to make a public
statement on the Russia investigation.**® Pompeo had no recollection of being asked to stay behind
after the March 22 briefing, but he recalled that the President regularly urged officials to get the
word out that he had not done anything wrong related to Russia.*?’

Coats told this Office that the President never asked him to speak to Comey about the FBI
investigation.**® Some ODNI staffers, however, had a different recollection of how Coats
described the meeting immediately after it occurred. According to senior ODNI official Michael
Dempsey, Coats said after the meeting that the President had brought up the Russia investigation
and asked him to contact Comey to see if there was a way to get past the investigation, get it over
with, end it, or words to that effect.3®® Dempsey said that Coats described the President’s
comments as falling “somewhere between musing about hating the investigation” and wanting
Coats to “do something to stop it.”**° Dempsey said Coats made it clear that he would not get
involved with an ongoing FBI investigation.*' Edward Gistaro, another ODNI official, recalled

that right after Coats’s meeting with the President, on the walk from the Oval Office back to the
Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Coats said that the President had kept him behind to ask
him what he could do to “help with the investigation.”*** Another ODNI staffer who had been
waiting for Coats outside the Oval Office talked to Gistaro a few minutes later and recalled Gistaro
reporting that Coats was upset because the President had asked him to contact Comey to convince
him there was nothing to the Russia investigation.3*®

On Saturday, March 25, 2017, three days after the meeting in the Oval Office, the President
called Coats and again complained about the Russia investigations, saying words to the effect of,
“I can’t do anything with Russia, there’s things I’d like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS,
they’re all over me with this.”>** Coats told the President that the investigations were going to go
on and the best thing to do was to let them run their course* Coats later testified in a
congressional hearing that he had “never felt pressure to intervene or interfere in any way and
shape—with shaping intelligence in a political way, or in relationship . . . to an ongoing
investigation.”346

On March 26, 2017, the day after the President called Coats, the President called NSA
Director Admiral Michael Rogers.>*” The President expressed frustration with the Russia
investigation, saying that it made relations with the Russians difficult.**® The President told
Rogers “the thing with the Russians [wal]s messing up” his ability to get things done with Russia.’*
The President also said that the news stories linking him with Russia were not true and asked
Rogers if he could do anything to refute the stories.”®® Deputy Director of the NSA Richard
Ledgett, who was present for the call, said it was the most unusual thing he had experienced in 40
years of government service.”>! After the call concluded, Ledgett prepared a memorandum that
he and Rogers both signed documenting the content of the conversation and the President’s
request, and they placed the memorandum in a safe.’® But Rogers did not perceive the President’s
request to be an order, and the President did not ask Rogers to push back on the Russia

had “never been directed to do anything [he] believe[d] to be illegal, immoral, unethical or
inappropriate” and did “not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.”**

In addition to the specific comments made to Coats, Pompeo, and Rogers, the President
spoke on other occasions in the presence of intelligence community officials about the Russia
investigation and stated that it interfered with his ability to conduct foreign relations.>>> On at least
two occasions, the President began Presidential Daily Briefings by stating that there was no
collusion with Russia and he hoped a press statement to that effect could be issued.**® Pompeo
recalled that the President vented about the investigation on multiple occasions, complaining that
there was no evidence against him and that nobody would publicly defend him.>>” Rogers recalled
a private conversation with the President in which he “vent[ed]” about the investigation, said he
had done nothing wrong, and said something like the “Russia thing has got to go away.”**® Coats
recalled the President bringing up the Russia investigation several times, and Coats said he finally
told the President that Coats’s job was to provide intelligence and not get involved in
investigations.**

explained “that we were running it down as quickly as possible and that there would be great
benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our Good Housekeeping seal of approval, but we had to do
our work.”*® Comey also told the President that congressional leaders were aware that the FBI
was not investigating the President personally.*** The President said several times, “We need to
get that fact out.”>®> The President commented that if there was “some satellite” (which Comey
took to mean an associate of the President’s or the campaign) that did something, “it would be
good to find that out” but that he himself had not done anything wrong and he hoped Comey
“would find a way to get out that we weren’t investigating him.”**® After the call ended, Comey
called Boente and told him about the conversation, asked for guidance on how to respond, and said
he was uncomfortable with direct contact from the President about the investigation.*®’

back, and he informed the President that the traditional channel for such a request would be to

step.’”" The President then added, “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that
thing, you know.”"? In a televised interview that was taped early that afternoon, the President was
asked if it was too late for him to ask Comey to step down; the President responded, “No, it’s not
too late, but you know, I have confidence in him. We’ll see what happens. You know, it’s going
to be interesting.”®™ After the interview, Hicks told the President she thought the President’s
comment about Comey should be removed from the broadcast of the interview, but the President
wanted to keep it in, which Hicks thought was unusual.*’

Later that day, the President told senior advisors, including McGahn and Priebus, that he
had reached out to Comey twice in recent weeks.*” The President acknowledged that McGahn
would not approve of the outreach to Comey because McGahn had previously cautioned the
President that he should not talk to Comey directly to prevent any perception that the White House
was interfering with investigations.’”® The President told McGahn that Comey had indicated the
FBI could make a public statement that the President was not under investigation if the Department
of Justice approved that action.’”” After speaking with the President, McGahn followed up with
Boente to relay the President’s understanding that the FBI could make a public announcement if
the Department of Justice cleared it.’”® McGahn recalled that Boente said Comey had told him
there was nothing obstructive about the calls from the President, but they made Comey
uncomfortable.’” According to McGahn, Boente responded that he did not want to issue a
statement about the President not being under investigation because of the potential political
ramifications and did not want to order Comey to do it because that action could prompt the

appointment of a Special Counsel.*®® Boente did not recall that aspect of his conversation with
McGahn, but did recall telling McGahn that the direct outreaches from the President to Comey
were a problem.3®! Boente recalled that McGahn agreed and said he would do what he could to
address that issue.’®

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s reaction to Sessions’s recusal and the requests he made to
Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of
obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive_act. The evidence shows that, after Comey’s March 20, 2017
testimony, the President repeatedly reached out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss the FBI’s
investigation. But witnesses had different recollections of the precise content of those outreaches.
Some ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them immediately after the March 22 Oval Office
meeting that the President asked Coats to intervene with Comey and “stop” the investigation. But
the first-hand witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently. Pompeo had no
memory of the specific meeting, but generally recalled the President urging officials to get the
word out that the President had not done anything wrong related to Russia. Coats recalled that the
President asked that Coats state publicly that no link existed between the President and Russia, but
did not ask him to speak with Comey or to help end the investigation. The other outreaches by the
President during this period were similar in nature. The President asked Rogers if he could do
anything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the President asked Comey to
malke a public statement that would “lift the cloud” of the ongoing investigation by making clear
that the President was not personally under investigation. These requests, while significant enough
that Rogers thought it important to document the encounter in a written memorandum, were not
interpreted by the officials who received them as directives to improperly interfere with the
investigation.

b. Nexus to a proceeding. At the time of the President’s outreaches to leaders of the
intelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI’s Russia investigation did not
yet involve grand jury proceedings. The outreaches, however, came after and were in response to
Comey’s March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI, as a part of its counterintelligence mission,
was conducting an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Comey testified that the investigation included any links or coordination with Trump campaign
officials and would “include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.”

C. Intent. As described above, the evidence does not establish that the President asked
or directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI’s Russia investigation—
and the President affirmatively told Comey that if “some satellite” was involved in Russian
election interference “it would be good to find that out.” But the President’s intent in trying to
prevent Sessions’s recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey following

Comey’s public announcement of the FBI’s Russia investigation, is nevertheless relevant to
understanding what motivated the President’s other actions towards the investigation.

The evidence shows that the President was focused on the Russia investigation’s
implications for his presidency—and, specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he was under
investigation or had links to Russia. In early March, the President attempted to prevent Sessions’s
recusal, even after being told that Sessions was following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules. After
Sessions recused, the White House Counsel’s Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions
about the matter, although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President. The
President continued to raise the issue of Sessions’s recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he
pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse. The President also told advisors that he wanted
an Attorney General who would protect him, the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric
Holder to have protected their presidents. The President made statements about being able to direct
the course of criminal investigations, saying words to the effect of, “You’re telling me that Bobby
and Jack didn’t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?”

After Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the FBI’s Russia investigation on March
20, 2017, the President was “beside himself” and expressed anger that Comey did not issue a
statement correcting any misperception that the President himself was under investigation. The
President sought to speak with Acting Attorney General Boente directly and told McGahn to
contact Boente to request that Comey make a clarifying statement. The President then asked other
intelligence community leaders to make public statements to refute the suggestion that the
President had links to Russia, but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the
investigation. On March 30 and April 11, against the advice of White House advisors who had
informed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be perceived as improper interference in
an ongoing investigation, the President made personal outreaches to Comey asking him to “lift the
cloud” of the Russia investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally
under investigation,

Evidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia
investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true
based on Comey’s representations. The President complained to advisors that if people thought
Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished.

Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia
investigation on his ability to govern. The President complained that the perception that he was
under investigation was hurting his ability to conduct foreign relations, particularly with Russia.
The President told Coats he “can’t do anything with Russia,” he told Rogers that “the thing with
the Russians” was interfering with his ability to conduct foreign affairs, and he told Comey that
“he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult.”

D. Events Leading Up To and Surrounding the Termination of FBI Director
Comey

Overview

Comey was scheduled to testify before Congress on May 3, 2017. Leading up to that
testimony, the President continued to tell advisors that he wanted Comey to make public that the
President was not under investigation. At the hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about
the scope or subjects of the Russia investigation and did not state publicly that the President was
not under investigation. Two days later, on May 5, 2017, the President told close aides he was
going to fire Comey, and on May 9, he did so, using his official termination letter to make public
that Comey had on three occasions informed the President that he was not under investigation.
The President decided to fire Comey before receiving advice or a recommendation from the
Department of Justice, but he approved an initial public account of the termination that attributed
it to a recommendation from the Department of Justice based on Comey’s handling of the Clinton
email investigation. After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the firing
to his recommendation, the President acknowledged that he intended to fire Comey regardless of
the DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia investigation when he made the decision.
The President also told the Russian Foreign Minister, “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was
crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off. . . . . I’'m not
under investigation.”

Evidence

1. Comey Testifies Before the Senate Judiciary Committee and Declines to
Answer Questions About Whether the President is Under Investigation

On May 3, 2017, Comey was scheduled to testify at an FBI oversight hearing before the
Senate Judiciary Committee.3** McGahn recalled that in the week leading up to the hearing, the
President said that it would be the last straw if Comey did not take the opportunity to set the record
straight by publicly announcing that the President was not under investigation.*** The President
had previously told McGahn that the perception that the President was under investigation was
hurting his ability to carry out his presidential duties and deal with foreign leaders.’® At the
hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about the status of the Russia investigation, stating
“[t}he Department of Justice ha[d] authorized [him] to confirm that [the Russia investigation]
exists,” but that he was “not going to say another word about it” until the investigation was
completed.*® Comey also declined to answer questions about whether investigators had “ruled

out anyone in the Trump campaign as potentially a target of th[e] criminal investigation,” including
whether the FBI had “ruled out the president of the United States.”**’

Comey was also asked at the hearing about his decision to announce 11 days before the
presidential election that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation.**® Comey stated
that it made him “mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,”
but added that “cven in hindsight” he “would make the same decision.”*®® He later repeated that
he had no regrets about how he had handled the email investigation and believed he had “done the
right thing at each turn.”*

In the afternoon following Comey’s testimony, the President met with McGahn, Sessions,
and Sessions’s Chief of Staff Jody Hunt.**' At that meeting, the President asked McGahn how
Comey had done in his testimony and McGahn relayed that Comey had declined to answer
questions about whether the President was under investigation.’” The President became very
upset and directed his anger at Sessions.”” According to notes written by Hunt, the President said,
“This is terrible Jeff. It’s all because you recused. AG is supposed to be most important
appointment. Kennedy appointed his brother. Obama appointed Holder. I appointed you and you
recused yourself. You left me on an island. I can’t do anything.*** The President said that the
recusal was unfair and that it was interfering with his ability to govern and undermining his
authority with foreign leaders.?® Sessions responded that he had had no choice but to recuse, and
it was a mandatory rather than discretionary decision.*®® Hunt recalled that Sessions also stated at

President should consider replacing Comey as FBI director.®*” According to Sessions, when the
meeting concluded, it was clear that the President was unhappy with Comey, but Sessions did not
think the President had made the decision to terminate Comey.**®

Bannon recalled that the President brought Comey up with him at least eight times on May
3 and May 4, 20173 According to Bannon, the President said the same thing each time: “He
told me three times I’m not under investigation. He’s a showboater. He’s a grandstander. [ don’t
know any Russians. There was no collusion.”**® Bannon told the President that he could not fire
Comey because “that ship had sailed.”*®' Bannon also told the President that firing Comey was
not going to stop the investigation, cautioning him that he could fire the FBI director but could not
fire the FBI.40?

2. The President Makes the Decision to Terminate Comey

The weekend following Comey’s May 3, 2017 testimony, the President traveled to his
resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.*”® At a dinner on Friday, May 5, attended by the President and
various advisors and family members, including Jared Kushner and senior advisor Stephen Miller,
the President stated that he wanted to remove Comey and had ideas for a letter that would be used
to make the announcement.*® The President dictated arguments and specific language for the
letter, and Miller took notes.*®> As reflected in the notes, the President told Miller that the letter
should start, “While I greatly appreciate you informing me that I am not under investigation
concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated story on a Trump-Russia relationship —
pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American
public — including Ds and Rs — have lost faith in you as Director of the FBL.”** Following the
dinner, Miller prepared a termination letter based on those notes and research he conducted to
support the President’s arguments.*”” Over the weekend, the President provided several rounds of

edits on the draft letter.*”® Miller said the President was adamant that he not tell anyone at the
White House what they were preparing because the President was worried about leaks."”

In his discussions with Miller, the President made clear that he wanted the letter to open
with a reference to him not being under investigation.*' Miller said he believed that fact was
important to the President to show that Comey was not being terminated based on any such
investigation.*'" According to Miller, the President wanted to establish as a factual matter that
Comey had been under a “review period” and did not have assurance from the President that he
would be permitted to keep his job.*!?

The final version of the termination letter prepared by Miller and the President began in a
way that closely tracked what the President had dictated to Miller at the May 5 dinner: “Dear
Director Comey, While I greatly appreciate your informing me, on three separate occasions, that [
am not under investigation concerning the fabricated and politically-motivated allegations of a
Trump-Russia relationship with respect to the 2016 Presidential Election, please be informed that
I, along with members of both political parties and, most importantly, the American Public, have
lost faith in you as the Director of the FBI and you are hereby terminated.”*'* The four-page letter
went on to critique Comey’s judgment and conduct, including his May 3 testimony before the
Senate Judiciary Committee, his handling of the Clinton email investigation, and his failure to hold
leakers accountable.'* The letter stated that Comey had “asked [the President] at dinner shortly
after inauguration to let [Comey] stay on in the Director’s role, and [the President] said that [he]
would consider it,” but the President had “concluded that [he] ha[d] no alternative but to find new
leadership for the Bureau — a leader that restores confidence and trust.”*"?

In the morning of Monday, May 8, 2017, the President met in the Oval Office with senior
advisors, including McGahn, Priebus, and Miller, and informed them he had decided to terminate
Comey."'® The President read aloud the first paragraphs of the termination letter he wrote with

Comey’s removal and a memorandum from Rosenstein, addressed to the Attorney General, titled
“Restoring Public Confidence in the FBL.”** McGahn recalled that the President liked the DOJ

Miller to draft a new termination letter and directed Miller to say in the letter that Comey had
informed the President three times that he was not under investigation.**> McGahn, Priebus, and

the President.**> Dhillon made a final pitch to the President that Comey should be permitted to
resign, but the President refused.**

Around the time the President’s letter was finalized, Priebus summoned Spicer and the
press team to the Oval Office, where they were told that Comey had been terminated for the reasons
stated in the letters by Rosenstein and Sessions.**” To announce Comey’s termination, the White
House released a statement, which Pricbus thought had been dictated by the President.** In full,
the statement read: “Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that
he has been terminated and removed from office. President Trump acted based on the clear
recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff
Sessions.”*4?

That evening, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was summoned to meet with the
President at the White House.**® The President told McCabe that he had fired Comey because of
the decisions Comey had made in the Clinton email investigation and for many other reasons.*!
The President asked McCabe if he was aware that Comey had told the President three times that
he was not under investigation.*> The President also asked McCabe whether many people in the
FBI disliked Comey and whether McCabe was part of the “resistance” that had disagreed with
Comey’s decisions in the Clinton investigation.*> McCabe told the President that he knew Comey
had told the President he was not under investigation, that most people in the FBI felt positively
about Comey, and that McCabe worked “very closely” with Comey and was part of all the
decisions that had been made in the Clinton investigation.**

the line that said Comey advised the President on three separate occasions that the President was not under

President’s decision to terminate Comey was driven by the recommendations the President
received from Rosenstein and Sessions.*¢’

In the morning on May 10, 2017, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office.*® The media
subsequently reported that during the May 10 meeting the President brought up his decision the
prior day to terminate Comey, telling Lavrov and Kislyak: “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He
was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off. . .. I’'m not
under investigation.”*® The President never denied making those statements, and the White House
did not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: “By grandstanding and
politicizing the investigation into Russia’s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on
our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. The investigation would have always continued,
and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is
that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified
information.”*’° Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with
Lavrov, he did not look concerned and said of Comey, “he is crazy.”*’' When McGahn asked the
President about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Comey was fired
because that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he
could get more work done.*”

That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe."” According to a
memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the
White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to

indicating their support for terminating Comey.*”> The President also told McCabe that Comey
should not have been permitted to travel back to Washington, D.C. on the FBI’s airplane after he
had been terminated and that he did not want Comey “in the building again,” even to collect his
belongings.*’® When McCabe met with the President that afternoon, the President, without
prompting, told McCabe that people in the FBI loved the President, estimated that at least 80% of
the FBI had voted for him, and asked McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 presidential
election *”’

In the afternoon of May 10, 2017, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders spoke to the
President about his decision to fire Comey and then spoke to reporters in a televised press
conference.*”® Sanders told reporters that the President, the Department of Justice, and bipartisan
members of Congress had lost confidence in Comey, “[a]nd most importantly, the rank and file of
the FBI had lost confidence in their director. Accordingly, the President accepted the
recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Comey from his position.”*"
In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided “on his own” to
review Comey’s performance and that Rosenstein decided “on his own” to come to the President
on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Comey. When a reporter indicated that the “vast
majority” of FBI agents supported Comey, Sanders said, “Look, we’ve heard from countless
members of the FBI that say very different things.”*® Following the press conference, Sanders
spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in
her comments.*®! Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from “countless members
of the FBI” was a “slip of the tongue.”®* She also recalled that her statement in a separate press
interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made
“in the heat of the moment” that was not founded on anything.***

Also on May 10, 2017, Sessions and Rosenstein each spoke to McGahn and expressed
concern that the White House was creating a narrative that Rosenstein had initiated the decision to

fire Comey.*®* The White House Counsel’s Office agreed that it was factually wrong to say that
the Department of Justice had initiated Comey’s termination,*® and McGahn asked attorneys in
the White House Counsel’s Office to work with the press office to correct the narrative.*®

The next day, on May 11, 2017, the President participated in an interview with Lester Holt.
The President told White House Counsel’s Office attorneys in advance of the interview that the
communications team could not get the story right, so he was going on Lester Holt to say what
really happened.*®” During the interview, the President stated that he had made the decision to fire
Comey before the President met with Rosenstein and Sessions. The President told Holt, “I was
going to fire regardless of recommendation . . . . [Rosenstein] made a recommendation. But
regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do
it.”*# The President continued, “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, T said to myself—I said,
you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It’s an excuse by the
Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.”*¥

In response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia
investigation, the President said, “As far as I’'m concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done
properly.”*° The President added that he realized his termination of Comey “probably maybe will
confuse people” with the result that it “might even lengthen out the investigation,” but he *ha[d]
to do the right thing for the American people” and Comey was “the wrong man for that position. 491
The President described Comey as “a showboat” and “a grandstander,” said that “[t]he FBI has
been in turmoil,” and said he wanted “to have a really competent, capable director.”*? The
President affirmed that he expected the new FBI director to continue the Russia investigation.*”

On the evening of May 11, 2017, following the Lester Holt interview, the President
tweeted, “Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a
Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.”** The same day, the media reported that the
President had demanded that Comey pledge his loyalty to the President in a private dinner shortly

after being sworn in.*>> Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, “Again, the
story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems
as an excuse for losing the election.”*® The President also tweeted, “James Comey better hope
that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” and “When
James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there
is no collusion, when does it end?**7

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s decision to fire Comey, the following evidence is relevant to
the elements of obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive act. The act of firing Comey removed the individual overseeing the
FBI’s Russia investigation. The President knew that Comey was personally involved in the
investigation based on Comey’s briefing of the Gang of Eight, Comey’s March 20, 2017 public
testimony about the investigation, and the President’s one-on-one conversations with Comey.

Firing Comey would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect
of interfering with or impeding the investigation—for example, if the termination would have the
effect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity
to appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President
perceived as more protective of his personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that
issue include whether the President’s actions had the potential to discourage a successor director
or other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The President fired
Comey abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building,
and criticized him publicly, calling him a “showboat” and claiming that the FBI was “in turmoil”
under his leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were
highly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Comey, the President
referred to the investigation as a “witch hunt” and asked, “when does it end?” Those actions had
the potential to affect a successor director’s conduct of the investigation.

The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to
prevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. As a general matter, FBI
investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director.
Bannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but
could not fire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Comey was fired
that said, “The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of
Comey would not have ended it.” In addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the
President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Comey that the action might
prolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to serve as interim director, even

though McCabe told the President he had worked “very closely” with Comey and was part of all
the decisions made in the Clinton investigation.

b. Nexus to a proceeding. The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing
that a grand jury proceeding or criminal prosecution arising from an FBI investigation was
objectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated Comey.

Several facts would be relevant to such a showing. At the time the President fired Comey,
a grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation and no grand jury
subpoenas had been issued. On March 20, 2017, however, Comey had announced that the FBI
was investigating Russia’s interference in the election, including “an assessment of whether any
crimes were committed.” Tt was widely known that the FBI, as part of the Russia investigation,
was investigating the hacking of the DNC’s computers—a clear criminal offense.

In addition, at the time the President fired Comey, evidence indicates the President knew
that Flynn was still under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted, despite the
President’s February 14, 2017 request that Comey “let[] Flynn go.” On March 5, 2017, the White
House Counsel’s Office was informed that the FBI was asking for transition-period records
relating to Flynn—indicating that the FBT was still actively investigating him. The same day, the
President told advisors he wanted to call Dana Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the
Russia investigation, to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated.
On March 31, 2017, the President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in legal jeopardy by
tweeting that “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity” before he agreed to provide testimony to the
FBI or Congress. And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a
message to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong,
further demonstrating the President’s awareness of Flynn’s criminal exposure.

c. Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President’s decision
to fire Comey was Comey’s unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally
under investigation, despite the President’s repeated requests that Comey make such an
announcement. In the week leading up to Comey’s May 3, 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee
testimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last straw if Comey did not set the record
straight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation. But during his May
3 testimony, Comey refused to answer questions about whether the President was being
investigated. Comey’s refusal angered the President, who criticized Sessions for leaving him
isolated and exposed, saying “You left me on an island.” Two days later, the President told
advisors he had decided to fire Comey and dictated a letter to Stephen Miller that began with a
reference to the fact that the President was not being investigated: “While I greatly appreciate you
informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated
story on a Trump-Russia relationship . . . .” The President later asked Rosenstein to include
“Russia” in his memorandum and to say that Comey had told the President that he was not under
investigation. And the President’s final termination letter included a sentence, at the President’s
insistence and against McGahn’s advice, stating that Comey had told the President on three
separate occasions that he was not under investigation.

The President’s other stated rationales for why he fired Comey are not similarly supported
by the evidence. The termination letter the President and Stephen Miller prepared in Bedminster

75

Attorney—-WorkProduet // May-Containr-Materiat-Proteeted-UnderFedR—Crim—P—6(e)

cited Comey’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired
Comey for that reason. But the facts surrounding Comey’s handling of the Clinton email
investigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the President
had made it clear to both Comey and the President’s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted
Comey to stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Comey’s handling of the
Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Comey. The President’s draft
termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the
press after Comey’s termination that the White House had heard from “countless” FBI agents who
had lost confidence in Comey. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told
Comey at their January 27 dinner that “the people of the FBI really like [him],” no evidence
suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Comey, and Sanders
acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything.

We also considered why it was important to the President that Comey announce publicly
that he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the
erroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and
foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Comey that the “cloud” of
“this Russia business” was making it difficult to run the country. The President told Sessions and
McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that
the perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues.
The President complained to Rogers that “the thing with the Russians [was] messing up” his ability
to get things done with Russia, and told Coats, “I can’t do anything with Russia, there’s things I’d
like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they’re all over me with this.” The President also
may have viewed Comey as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that
the President was not under investigation.

Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an
investigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI’s interview of Flynn, the
President had a one-on-one dinner with Comey, against the advice of senior aides, and told Comey
he needed Comey’s “loyalty.” When the President later asked Comey for a second time to make -
public that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying “Because I have
been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.” After the President learned of
Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an
Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder
to have protected their presidents. The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney
General “who to investigate.”

In addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI’s Russia investigation behind him.
The evidence does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover up a
conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence
uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were
involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the
President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does
indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the
President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise
to personal and political concerns. Although the President publicly stated during and after the
election that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through Michael Cohen,

76

was pursuing the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project through June 2016 and candidate Trump
was repeatedly briefed on the progress of those efforts.*”® In addition, some witnesses said that
Trump was aware that [EEHIKCRENTTINISEERTT
: at a time when public reports stated that Russian intelligence officials were behind the
hacks, and that Trump privately sought information about future Wikil.eaks releases.*”” More
broadly, multiple witnesses described the President’s preoccupation with press coverage of the
Russia investigation and his persistent concern that it raised questions about the legitimacy of his
election.”™

Finally, the President and White House aides initially advanced a pretextual reason to the
press and the public for Comey’s termination. In the immediate aftermath of the firing, the
President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the DOJ
recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story. But the President had
decided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those recommendations. Although the
President ultimately acknowledged that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Department
of Justice’s recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would
resist the White House’s suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey’s
termination. The initial reliance on a pretextual justification could support an inference that the
President had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing, although the evidence does
not resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or both.

E. The President’s Efforts to Remove the Special Counsel
Overview

The Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting
the President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had
failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President
ultimately did not accept. The President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts
of interest, but they responded that those claims were “ridiculous” and posed no obstacle to the
Special Counsel’s service. Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the Special
Counsel’s service. On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President was being personally
investigated for obstruction of justice and the President responded with a series of tweets

499 See Volume I, Section II1.D.1, supra.

9 Tn addition to whether the President had a motive related to Russia-related matters that an FBI
investigation could uncover, we considered whether the President’s intent in firing Comey was connected
to other conduct that could come to light as a result of the FBI’s Russian-interference investigation. In
particular, Michael Cohen was a potential subject of investigation because of his pursuit of the Trump
Tower Moscow project and involvement in other activities. And facts uncovered in the Russia
investigation, which our Office referred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New
York, ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District of New York for campaign-finance
offenses related to payments he said he made at the direction of the President. See Volume II, Section
ILK.5, infra. The investigation, however, did not establish that when the President fired Comey, he was
considering the possibility that the FBI’s investigation would uncover these payments or that the President’s
intent in firing Comey was otherwise connected to a concern about these matters coming to light.

criticizing the Special Counsel’s investigation. That weekend, the President called McGahn and
directed him to have the Special Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest.
McGahn did not carry out the instruction for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday
Night Massacre and instead prepared to resign. McGahn ultimately did not quit and the President
did not follow up with McGahn on his request to have the Special Counsel removed.

Evidence
1. The Appointment of the Special Counsel and the President’s Reaction

On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rosenstein appointed Robert S. Mueller, I1T as
Special Counsel and authorized him to conduct the Russia investigation and matters that arose
from the investigation.®® The President learned of the Special Counsel’s appointment from
Sessions, who was with the President, Hunt, and McGahn conducting interviews for a new FBI
Director.’® Sessions stepped out of the Oval Office to take a call from Rosenstein, who told him
about the Special Counsel appointment, and Sessions then returned to inform the President of the
news.’® According to notes written by Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special
Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, “Oh my God. This
is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked.”* The President became angry and
lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, “How
could you let this happen, Jeff?*" The President said the position of Attorney General was his
most important appointment and that Sessions had “let [him] down,” contrasting him to Eric
Holder and Robert Kennedy.’®® Sessions recalled that the President said to him, “you were
supposed to protect me,” or words to that effect.’®” The President returned to the consequences of
the appointment and said, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins
your presidency. It takes years and years and [ won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst
thing that ever happened to me.”*%

3. The Press Reports that the President is Being Investigated for Obstruction of
Justice and the President Directs the White House Counsel to Have the Special
Counsel Removed

On the evening of June 14, 2017, the Washington Post published an article stating that the
Special Counsel was investigating whether the President had attempted to obstruct justice.”" This
was the first public report that the President himself was under investigation by the Special
Counsel’s Office, and cable news networks quickly picked up on the report.’®> The Post story
stated that the Special Counsel was interviewing intelligence community leaders, including Coats
and Rogers, about what the President had asked them to do in response to Comey’s March 20,
2017 testimony; that the inquiry into obstruction marked “a major turning point” in the
investigation; and that while “Trump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director
James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation,” “[o]fficials
say that changed shortly after Comey’s firing.”*® That evening, at approximately 10:31 p.m., the
President called McGahn on McGahn’s personal cell phone and they spoke for about 15
minutes.’®* McGahn did not have a clear memory of the call but thought they might have discussed
the stories reporting that the President was under investigation.”®

Beginning early the next day, June 15, 2017, the President issued a series of tweets
acknowledging the existence of the obstruction investigation and criticizing it. He wrote: “They
made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for
obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice”;**® “You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH
HUNT in American political history—led by some very bad and conflicted people!”;*” and

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed,
the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive act. As with the President’s firing of Comey, the attempt to remove
the Special Counsel would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the

investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry. Even ifthe removal
of the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a new appointee,
a factfinder would need to consider whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the
investigation, chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the
investigation.

A threshold question is whether the President in fact directed McGahn to have the Special
Counsel removed. After news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly disputed these accounts, and
privately told McGahn that he had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the
Department of Justice’s attention. See Volume II, Section ILI, infra. Some of the President’s
specific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation.
Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact
directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed.

First, McGahn’s clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein
not only that conflicts existed but also that “Mueller has to go.” McGahn is a credible witness
with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.*”! McGahn
spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it
unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President’s request. In response to that request,
MecGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin
to the Saturday Night Massacre. He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his
office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President
had asked him to “do crazy shit,” and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving. Those
acts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of
Justice.

Second, in the days before the calls to McGahn, the President, through his counsel, had
already brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice. Accordingly,
the President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues
that already had been raised.

Third, the President’s sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate
action on a weekend—“You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.”—support McGahn’s recollection
that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel.
Had the President instead sought only to have the Department of Justice re-examine asserted
conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the
process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.

Finally, the President had discussed “knocking out Mueller” and raised conflicts of interest
in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan
to remove the Special Counsel. And in the days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made
clear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating

 

691 When this Office first interviewed McGahn about this topic, he was reluctant to share detailed
information about what had occurred and only did so after continued questioning. See McGahn 12/14/17

the Special Counsel. Also during this time period, the President reached out to Christie to get his
thoughts on firing the Special Counsel. This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking
an examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a
way to terminate the Special Counsel.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would
be necessary to establish a nexus between the President’s act of seeking to terminate the Special
Counsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding.

Substantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct was
under investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal crimes to a
grand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the President that his “biggest exposure”
was not his act of firing Comey but his “other contacts” and “calls,” and his “ask re: Flynn.” By
early June, it was widely reported in the media that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury
subpoenas in the Flynn inquiry and that the Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn
investigation.®> On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel’s Office informed the White House that
investigators would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedly had been asked by
the President to push back against the Russia investigation. On June 14, 2017, news outlets began
reporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice. Based on
widespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could include his request for
Comey’s loyalty; his request that Comey “let[] Flynn go”; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and
his termination of Comey and statement to the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had
relieved “great pressure” related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his
conduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting, “I am being investigated for
firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!”

c. Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President’s attempts to remove the
Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel’s oversight of investigations that involved the
President’s conduct—and, most immediately, to reports that the President was being investigated
for potential obstruction of justice.

Before the President terminated Comey, the President considered it critically important that
he was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being investigated.
As described in Volume 11, Section I1.D, supra, advisors perceived the President, while he was
drafting the Comey termination letter, to be concerned more than anything else about getting out
that he was not personally under investigation. When the President learned of the appointment of
the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further concern about the investigation, saying
“[t]his is the end of my Presidency.” The President also faulted Sessions for recusing, saying “you
were supposed to protect me.”

On June 14, 2017, when the Washington Post reported that the Special Counsel was
investigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had wanted

to avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of widespread media
attention. The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction investigation prompted the President
to call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel removed. By mid-June, the Department of
Justice had already cleared the Special Counsel’s service and the President’s advisors had told him
that the claimed conflicts of interest were “silly” and did not provide a basis to remove the Special
Counsel. On June 13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good
cause for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the President dictated a press statement to
Sanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special Counsel. But the next day, the media
reported that the President was under investigation for obstruction of justice and the Special
Counsel was interviewing witnesses about events related to possible obstruction—spurring the
President to write critical tweets about the Special Counsel’s investigation. The President called
McGahn at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David. The evidence
accordingly indicates that news that an obstruction investigation had been opened is what led the
President to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated.

There also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made those calls to
McGahn. The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told the
President that the White House Counsel’s Office—and McGahn himself—could not be involved
in pressing conflicts claims and that the President should consult with his personal counsel if he
wished to raise conflicts. Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims,
the President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel. And after the media
reported on the President’s actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special
Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in
Volume 11, Section ILI, infra. Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the
President’s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper.

F. The President’s Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation
Overview

Two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the
President made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017,
the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message
to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia
investigation to future election interference only. One month later, the President met again with
Lewandowski and followed up on the request to have Sessions limit the scope of the Russia
investigation. Lewandowski told the President the message would be delivered soon. Hours later,
the President publicly criticized Sessions in an unplanned press interview, raising questions about
Sessions’s job security.

1. The President Asks Corey Lewandowski to Deliver a Message to Sessions to
Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation

Counsel removed, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign

manager Corey Lewandowski.’”® Senior White House advisors described Lewandowski as a

“devotee” of the President and said the relationship between the President and Lewandowski was
“close.”6%

During the June 19 meeting, Lewandowski recalled that, after some small talk, the
President brought up Sessions and criticized his recusal from the Russia investigation.”® The
President told Lewandowski that Sessions was weak and that if the President had known about the
likelihood of recusal in advance, he would not have appointed Sessions.’” The President then
asked Lewandowski to deliver a message to Sessions and said “write this down.”®” This was the
first time the President had asked Lewandowski to take dictation, and Lewandowski wrote as fast
as possible to make sure he captured the content correctly.®”®

The President directed that Sessions should give a speech publicly announcing:

I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our
POTUS... is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel
b/c he hasn’t done anything wrong. [ was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there
were no Russians involved with him. T know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn’t do
anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.5%

The dictated message went on to state that Sessions would meet with the Special Counsel to limit
his jurisdiction to future election interference:

Now a group of people want to subvert the Constitution of the United States. I am going
to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special
Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that
nothing can happen in future elections.®!

3. The President Publicly Criticizes Sessions in a New York Times Interview

Within hours of the President’s meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President
gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he criticized Sessions’s decision to
recuse from the Russia investigation.®®® The President said that “Sessions should have never
recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the
job, and I would have picked somebody else.”®' Sessions’s recusal, the President said, was “very
unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused
himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I can’t, you know, I’m not going to

4. The President Orders Priebus to Demand Sessions’s Resignation

Three days later, on July 21, 2017, the Washington Post reported that U.S. intelligence
intercepts showed that Sessions had discussed campaign-related matters with the Russian
ambassador, contrary to what Sessions had said publicly.®® That evening, Priebus called Hunt to
talk about whether Sessions might be fired or might resign.® Priebus had previously talked to
Hunt when the media had reported on tensions between Sessions and the President, and, after
speaking to Sessions, Hunt had told Priebus that the President would have to fire Sessions if he
wanted to remove Sessions because Sessions was not going to quit.**" According to Hunt, who
took contemporaneous notes of the July 21 call, Hunt told Priebus that, as they had previously
discussed, Sessions had no intention of resigning %' Hunt asked Priebus what the President would

an investigation after.5*?

Early the following morning, July 22, 2017, the President tweeted, “A new
INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.
These illegal leaks, like Comey’s, must stop!”®* Approximately one hour later, the President
tweeted, “So many people are asking why isn’t the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many
Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?”%** Later that morning, while aboard
Marine One on the way to Norfolk, Virginia, the President told Priebus that he had to get Sessions
to resign immediately.** The President said that the country had lost confidence in Sessions and
the negative publicity was not tolerable.®*® According to contemporaneous notes taken by Priebus,
the President told Priebus to say that he “need[ed] a letter of resignation on [his] desk immediately”
and that Sessions had “no choice” but “must immediately resign.”®’ Priebus replied that if they
fired Sessions, they would never get a new Attorney General confirmed and that the Department
of Justice and Congress would turn their backs on the President, but the President suggested he
could make a recess appointment to replace Sessions.®®

Priebus believed that the President’s request was a problem, so he called McGahn and
asked for advice, explaining that he did not want to pull the trigger on something that was “all
wrong.”®*®  Although the President tied his desire for Sessions to resign to Sessions’s negative
press and poor performance in congressional testimony, Priebus believed that the President’s
desire to replace Sessions was driven by the President’s hatred of Sessions’s recusal from the
Russia investigation.®®® McGahn told Priebus not to follow the President’s order and said they
should consult their personal counsel, with whom they had attorney-client privilege.' McGahn

and Priebus discussed the possibility that they would both have to resign rather than carry out the
President’s order to fire Sessions.®*

That afternoon, the President followed up with Priebus about demanding Sessions’s
resignation, using words to the effect of, “Did you get it? Are you working on it?”*>* Priebus said
that he believed that his job depended on whether he followed the order to remove Sessions,
although the President did not directly say s0.®** Even though Priebus did not intend to carry out
the President’s directive, he told the President he would get Sessions to resign.®® Later in the day,

and the President would be unable to get anyone else confirmed.®*® The President agreed to hold
off on demanding Sessions’s resignation until after the Sunday shows the next day, to prevent the
shows from focusing on the firing.®’

By the end of that weekend, Pricbus recalled that the President relented and agreed not to
ask Sessions to resign.®*® Over the next several days, the President tweeted about Sessions. On
the morning of Monday, July 24, 2017, the President criticized Sessions for neglecting to

General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-

didn’t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in
charge of Clinton investigation.”®®' According to Hunt, in light of the President’s frequent public
attacks, Sessions prepared another resignation letter and for the rest of the year carried it with him
in his pocket every time he went to the White House.

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s efforts to have Lewandowski deliver a message directing
Sessions to publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future
election interference, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive act. The President’s effort to send Sessions a message through
Lewandowski would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation
and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.

The President sought to have Sessions announce that the President “shouldn’t have a
Special Prosecutor/Counsel” and that Sessions was going to “meet with the Special Prosecutor to
explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election
meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.” The President wanted
Sessions to disregard his recusal from the investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ
ethics review, and have Sessions declare that he knew “for a fact” that “there were no Russians
involved with the campaign” because he “was there.” The President further directed that Sessions
should explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation “because he hasn’t done
anything wrong.” Taken together, the President’s directives indicate that Sessions was being
instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation into the President and his
campaign, with the Special Counsel being permitted to “move forward wnth investigating election
meddling for future elections.”

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President’s
initial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand jury
investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. By the time of the
President’s follow-up meeting with Lewandowski,

      
 
 
 
 

 

 
 

See Volume I, Section II.G, infra. To satisfy the nexus requirement,
it would be necessary to show that limiting the Special Counsel’s investigation would have the
natural and probable effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding.

C. Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President’s effort to have Sessions
limit the scope of the Special Counsel’s investigation to future election interference was intended
to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President’s and his campaign’s conduct.

As previously described, see Volume II, Section I1.B, supra, the President knew that the
Russia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations of Russian
interference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election. The President further knew that the
investigation had broadened to include his own conduct and whether he had obstructed justice.
Those investigations would not proceed if the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction were limited to future
election interference only.

The timing and circumstances of the President’s actions support the conclusion that he
sought that result. The President’s initial direction that Sessions should limit the Special Counsel’s
investigation came just two days after the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special
Counsel removed, which itself followed public reports that the President was personally under

97


==================== PAGE 311 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WerlcProduet // May-Contain-Materiel-Proteeted-Under Fed—R—Crim—P—6(e)

investigation for obstruction of justice. The sequence of those events raises an inference that after
seeking to terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign’s
conduct from the investigation’s scope. The President raised the matter with Lewandowski again
on July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between
Russians and senior campaign officials had been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media
coverage and investigative interest.

The manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent. Rather
than rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office. The
President selected a loyal “devotee” outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting
an inference that he was working outside White House channels, including McGahn, who had
previously resisted contacting the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel. The President
also did not contact the Acting Attorney General, who had just testified publicly that there was no
cause to remove the Special Counsel. Instead, the President tried to use Sessions to restrict and
redirect the Special Counsel’s investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly
take any action on it.

The July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President’s intent. The President
followed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one month after he first dictated
the message for Sessions, demonstrating he still sought to pursue the request. And just hours after
Lewandowski assured the President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the
President gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked
Sessions and raised questions about his job security. Four days later, on July 22, 2017, the
President directed Priebus to obtain Sessions’s resignation. That evidence could raise an inference
that the President wanted Sessions to realize that his job might be on the line as he evaluated
whether to comply with the President’s direction that Sessions publicly announce that,
notwithstanding his recusal, he was going to confine the Special Counsel’s investigation to future
election interference.

G. The President’s Efforts to Prevent Disclosure of Emails About the June 9,2016
Meeting Between Russians and Senior Campaign Officials

Overview

By June 2017, the President became aware of emails setting up the June 9, 2016 meeting
between senior campaign officials and Russians who offered derogatory information on Hillary
Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” On multiple occasions
in late June and early July 2017, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails,
and he then dictated a statement about the meeting to be issued by Donald Trump Jr. describing
the meeting as about adoption.

Evidence

1. The President Learns About the Existence of Emails Concerning the June 9.
2016 Trump Tower Meeting

In mid-June 2017—the same week that the President first asked Lewandowski to pass a
message to Sessions—senior Administration officials became aware of emails exchanged during

the campaign arranging a meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and
a Russian attorney.?® As described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra, the emails stated that the
“Crown [P]rosecutor of Russia” had offered “to provide the Trump campaign with some official
documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as part
of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”*** Trump Jr. responded, “[T]f it’s what
you say I love it,”®®> and he, Kushner, and Manafort met with the Russian attorney and several
other Russian individuals at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016.°°® At the meeting, the Russian attorney
claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and
other Democrats, and the Russian attorney then spoke about the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. statute
that imposed financial and travel sanctions on Russian officials and that had resulted in a retaliatory
ban in Russia on U.S. adoptions of Russian children.5’

According to written answers submitted by the President in response to questions from this
Office, the President had no recollection of learning of the meeting or the emails setting it up at the
time the meeting occurred or at any other time before the election.*®®

The Trump Campaign had previously received a document request from SSCI that called
for the production of various information, including, “[a] list and a description of all meetings”
between any “individual affiliated with the Trump campaign” and “any individual formally or
informally affiliated with the Russian government or Russian business interests which took place
between June 16, 2015, and 12 pm on January 20, 2017,” and associated records.® Trump
Organization attorneys became aware of the June 9 meeting no later than the first week of June
2017, when they began interviewing the meeting participants, and the Trump Organization
attorneys provided the emails setting up the meeting to the President’s personal counsel.*” Mark
Corallo, who had been hired as a spokesman for the President’s personal legal team, recalled that
he learned about the June 9 meeting around June 21 or 22, 2017.5”" Priebus recalled learning about

said, “then leave it alone.”®®! Hicks also recalled that the President said Kushner’s attorney should

be leaked to the press.5? Raffel later heard from Hicks that the President had directed the group
not to be proactive in disclosing the emails because the President believed they would not leak.*”

3. The President Directs Trump Jr.’s Response to Press Inquiries About the
June 9 Meeting

The following week, the President departed on an overseas trip for the G20 summit in
Hamburg, Germany, accompanied by Hicks, Raffel, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump, among others.®*
On July 7, 2017, while the President was overseas, Hicks and Raffel learned that the New York
Times was working on a story about the June 9 meeting.*® The next day, Hicks told the President
about the story and he directed her not to comment.5® Hicks thought the President’s reaction was
odd because he usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.%" Later that
day, Hicks and the President again spoke about the story.®”® Hicks recalled that the President asked

her what the meeting had been about, and she said that she had been told the meeting was about
Russian adoption.?®® The President responded, “then just say that.”’*

On the flight home from the G20 on July 8, 2017, Hicks obtained a draft statement about
the mecting to be released by Trump Jr. and brought it to the President.”’ The draft statement
began with a reference to the information that was offered by the Russians in setting up the
meeting: “I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe
pageant with an individual who T was told might have information helpful to the campaign.”?
Hicks again wanted to disclose the entire story, but the President directed that the statement not be
issued because it said too much.”® The President told Hicks to say only that Trump Jr. took a brief
meeting and it was about Russian adoption.” After speaking with the President, Hicks texted
Trump Jr. a revised statement on the June 9 meeting that read:

It was a short meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We discussed a program about
the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years
ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at
that time and there was no follow up.””

Hicks’s text concluded, “Are you ok with this? Attributed to you.”’*® Trump Jr. responded by
text message that he wanted to add the word “primarily” before “discussed” so that the statement
would read, “We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.””*” Trump
Jr. texted that he wanted the change because “[t]hey started with some Hillary thing which was bs
and some other nonsense which we shot down fast.”’%® Hicks texted back, “I think that’s right too
but boss man worried it invites a lot of questions[.] [U]ltimately [d]efer to you and [your attorney]
on that word Be I know it’s important and I think the mention of a campaign issue adds something
to it in case we have to go further.””® Trump Jr. responded, “If I don’t have it in there it appears
as though I’m lying later when they inevitably leak something.””'® Trump Jr.’s statement—adding

the word “primarily” and making other minor additions—was then provided to the New York
Times.”!! The full statement provided to the Times stated:

It was a short introductory meeting. [ asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily
discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular
with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it
was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the
meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person | would be meeting
with beforehand.”!2

The statement did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton or any discussion
of the Magnitsky Act or U.S. sanctions, which were the principal subjects of the meeting, as
described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra.

A short while later, while still on Air Force One, Hicks learned that Priebus knew about
the emails, which further convinced her that additional information about the June 9 meeting would
leak and the White House should be proactive and get in front of the story.”"® Hicks recalled again
going to the President to urge him that they should be fully transparent about the June 9 meeting,
but he again said no, telling Hicks, “You’ve given a statement. We’re done.””™

Later on the flight home, Hicks went to the President’s cabin, where the President was on
the phone with one of his personal attorneys.”'> At one point the President handed the phone to
Hicks, and the attorney told Hicks that he had been working with Circa News on a separate story,

its story about the June 9, 2016 meeting.”'” In addition to the statement from Trump Jr., the Times

questioned whether Democratic operatives had arranged the June 9 meeting to create the
appearance of improper connections between Russia and Trump family members.”"® Hicks was
upset about Corallo’s public statement and called him that evening to say the President had not
approved the statement.’

The next day, July 9, 2017, Hicks and the President called Corallo together and the
President criticized Corallo for the statement he had released.”™' Corallo told the President the
statement had been authorized and further observed that Trump Jr.’s statement was inaccurate and
that a document existed that would contradict it.”*?> Corallo said that he purposely used the term
“document” to refer to the emails setting up the June 9 meeting because he did not know what the
President knew about the emails.”? Corallo recalled that when he referred to the “document” on
the call with the President, Hicks responded that only a few people had access to it and said “it
will never get out.”’* Corallo took contemporaneous notes of the call that say: “Also mention
existence of doc. Hope says ‘only a few people have it. Tt will never get out.”’* Hicks later told
investigators that she had no memory of making that comment and had always believed the emails
would eventually be leaked, but she might have been channeling the President on the phone call
because it was clear to her throughout her conversations with the President that he did not think
the emails would leak.”

On July 11, 2017, Trump Jr. posted redacted images of the emails setting up the June 9
meeting on Twitter; the New York Times reported that he did so “[a]fter being told that The Times
was about to publish the content of the emails.””?" Later that day, the media reported that the
President had been personally involved in preparing Trump Jr.’s initial statement to the New York
Times that had claimed the meeting “primarily” concerned “a program about the adoption of
Russian children.””?® Over the next several days, the President’s personal counsel repeatedly and

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s actions regarding the disclosure of information about the June
9 meeting, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive act. On at least three occasions between June 29, 2017, and July 9,
2017, the President directed Hicks and others not to publicly disclose information about the June

 

™ See, e.g., David Wright, Trump lawyer: President was aware of "nothing”, CNN (July 12,2017)
(quoting the President’s personal attorney as saying, “I wasn’t involved in the statement drafting at all nor
was the President.”); see also Good Morning America, ABC (July 12, 2017) (“The President didn’t sign
off on anything. . . . The President wasn’t involved in that.”); Meet the Press, NBC (July 16, 2017) (“I do
want to be clear—the President was not involved in the drafting of the statement.”).

9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian attorney. On June 29, Hicks
warned the President that the emails setting up the June 9 meeting were “really bad” and the story
would be “massive” when it broke, but the President told her and Kushner to “leave it alone.”
Early on July 8, after Hicks told the President the New York Times was working on a story about
the June 9 meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the
President usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin. Later that day, the
President rejected Trump Jr.’s draft statement that would have acknowledged that the meeting was
with “an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.” The
President then dictated a statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption
(which the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting). The statement dictated
by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton.

Each of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was directed
at the press. They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President, by taking these actions,
sought to withhold information from or mislead congressional investigators or the Special Counsel.
On May 17, 2017, the President’s campaign received a document request from SSCI that clearly
covered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails, and those documents also plainly would have
been relevant to the Special Counsel’s investigation.

But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or
other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special
Counsel. The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and
prevent their public release occurred in the context of developing a press strategy. The only
evidence we have of the President discussing the production of documents to Congress or the
Special Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when Hicks recalled the President
acknowledging that Kushner’s attorney should provide emails related to the June 9 meeting to
whomever he needed to give them to. We do not have evidence of what the President discussed
with his own lawyers at that time.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President’s
attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of
a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge, and the
President had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the
nexus requirement, however, it would be necessary to show that preventing the release of the
emails to the public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury
proceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted above, the evidence does not establish that the
President sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official proceedings.

) Intent. The evidence establishes the President’s substantial involvement in the
communications strategy related to information about his campaign’s connections to Russia and
his desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections. The President became aware
of the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner, and
he could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017, when lawyers for the Trump
Organization began interviewing witnesses who participated in the June 9 meeting. The President
thereafier repeatedly rejected the advice of Hicks and other staffers to publicly release information
about the June 9 meeting. The President expressed concern that multiple people had access to the
emails and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter. And the President

dictated a statement to be released by Trump Jr. in response to the first press accounts of the June
9 meeting that said the meeting was about adoption.

But as described above, the evidence does not establish that the President intended to
prevent the Special Counsel’s Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up the June 9
meeting or other information about that meeting. The statement recorded by Corallo—that the
emails “will never get out”—can be explained as reflecting a belief that the emails would not be
made public if the President’s press strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to
Congress and the Special Counsel.

H. The President’s Further Efforts to Have the Attorney General Take Over the
Investigation

Overview

From summer 2017 through 2018, the President attempted to have Attorney General
Sessions reverse his recusal, take control of the Special Counsel’s investigation, and order an
investigation of Hillary Clinton.

Evidence
1. The President Again Seeks to Have Sessions Reverse his Recusal

After returning Sessions’s resignation letter at the end of May 2017, but before the
President’s July 19, 2017 New York Times interview in which he publicly criticized Sessions for
recusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessions reverse
his recusal. In particular, at some point after the May 17, 2017 appointment of the Special Counsel,
Sessions recalled, the President called him at home and asked if Sessions would “unrecuse”
himself.”*® According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions
could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the “gist”
of the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from “all of it,” including
the Special Counsel’s Russia investigation.”?” Sessions listened but did not respond, and he did
not reverse his recusal or order an investigation of Clinton.”®

In early July 2017, the President asked Staff Secretary Rob Porter what he thought of
Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand.” Porter recalled that the President asked him if Brand
was good, tough, and “on the team.””*® The President also asked if Porter thought Brand was
interested in being responsible for the Special Counsel’s investigation and whether she would want

to be Attorney General one day.”! Because Porter knew Brand, the President asked him to sound
her out about taking responsibility for the investigation and being Attorney General.”*?
Contemporaneous notes taken by Porter show that the President told Porter to “Keep in touch with
your friend,” in reference to Brand.”** Later, the President asked Porter a few times in passing
whether he had spoken to Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable
with the task.”** Tn asking him to reach out to Brand, Porter understood the President to want to
find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel, although the President
never said so explicitly.”* Porter did not contact Brand because he was sensitive to the
implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an
effort to end the investigation or fire the Special Counsel.”®

McGahn recalled that during the summer of 2017, he and the President discussed the fact
that if Sessions were no longer in his position the Special Counsel would report directly to a non-
recused Attorney General.™” McGahn told the President that things might not change much under
a new Attorney General.”*® McGahn also recalled that in or around July 2017, the President
frequently brought up his displeasure with Sessions.™® Hicks recalled that the President viewed
Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation as an act of disloyalty.”*® In addition to criticizing
Sessions’s recusal, the President raised other concerns about Sessions and his job performance
with McGahn and Hicks.”!

were no longer in his position, Brand would, by default, become the DOJ official in charge of supervising
the Special Counsel’s investigatiori, and if both Sessions and Rosenstein were removed, Brand would be
next in line to become Acting Attorney General for all DOJ matters. See 28 U.S.C. § 508.

2. Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered
by his Recusal

Later in 2017, the President continued to urge Sessions to reverse his recusal from
campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an Attorney General who
would not be recused.

On October 16, 2017, the President met privately with Sessions and said that the
Department of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the
Department should be investigating.”? According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who
was at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton’s emails and said, “Don’t have to tell us, just
take [a] look.””* Sessions did not offer any assurances or promises to the President that the
Department of Justice would comply with that request.””* Two days later, on October 18, 2017,
the President tweeted, “Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating
Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed,
including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this-obviously a fix? Where
is Justice Dept?””>> On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was “ANGER &
UNITY” over a “lack of investigation” of Clinton and “the Comey fix,” and concluded: “DO
SOMETHING!”"

On December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with
the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end
of a cabinet meeting.””” During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President
again suggested that Sessions could “unrecuse,” which Porter linked to taking back supervision of
the Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton.”® According to
contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said, “I don’t know if you could un-recuse
yourself. You’d be a hero. Not telling you to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get
involved. Can order AG to investigate. I don’t want to get involved. I’m not going to get involved.
I’m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.””
According to Porter’s notes, Sessions responded, “We are taking steps; whole new leadership

anything that was impropet,” which Porter thought was noteworthy because it did not fit with the
previous discussion about Clinton.” Porter understood Sessions to be reassuring the President
that he was on the President’s team.”s

At the end of December, the President told the New York Times it was “too bad” that
Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation.”® When asked whether Holder had
been a more loyal Attorney General to President Obama than Sessions was to him, the President
said, “I don’t want to get into loyalty, but I will tell you that, I will say this: Holder protected
President Obama. Totally protected him. When you look at the things that they did, and Holder
protected the president. And I have great respect for that, I’ll be honest.””®* Later in January, the
President brought up the idea of replacing Sessions and told Porter that he wanted to “clean house”
at the Department of Justice.”® In a meeting in the White House residence that Porter attended on
January 27, 2018, Porter recalled that the President talked about the great attorneys he had in the
past with successful win records, such as Roy Cohn and Jay Goldberg, and said that one of his
biggest failings as President was that he had not surrounded himself with good attorneys, citing
Sessions as an example.”®® The President raised Sessions’s recusal and brought up and criticized
the Special Counsel’s investigation.”’

Over the next several months, the President continued to criticize Sessions in tweets and

the Russia investigation despite his recusal.”®® On June 5, 2018, for example, the President

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control
of the Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidence are relevant to the elements
of obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive act. To determine if the President’s efforts to have the Attorney General
unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether
those actions would naturally impede the Russia investigation. That inquiry would take into
account the supervisory role that the Attorney General, if unrecused, would play in the Russia
investigation. It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General’s recusal covered

place!”™).

other campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not turn on what Attorney General Sessions
would actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts to reverse his recusal would naturally
have had the effect of impeding the Russia investigation.

On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his
recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and
prosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessions recalled the
President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive. When the President
raised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by Porter, “Not telling
you to do anything. . . . I’'m not going to get involved. I’'m not going to do anything or direct you
to do anything. T just want to be treated fairly.” The duration of the President’s efforts—which
spanned from March 2017 to August 2018—and the fact that the President repeatedly criticized
Sessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is
relevant to assessing whether the President’s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as
obstructive acts.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence
of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. In addition,
in July 2017, a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the
District of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August
2017.77¢ Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on
those proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the
obstructive-act element.

c. Intent. There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President’s conduct toward
Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a
way that would restrict its scope. By the summer of 2017, the President was aware that the Special
Counsel was investigating him personally for obstruction of justice. And in the wake of the
disclosures of emails about the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the
campaign, see Volume II, Section II.G, supra, it was evident that the investigation into the
campaign now included the President’s son, son-in-law, and former campaign manager. The
President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announce that the
Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference. Yet Sessions
remained recused. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to
Sessions in the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if
he unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President’s desire that Sessions take back
supervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary Clinton. The
President said in that meeting that he “just want[ed] to be treated fairly,” which could reflect his
perception that it was unfair that he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. Buta
principal effect of that act would be to restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the
Attorney General—a position that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by
someone like Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their

presidents. A reasonable inference from those statements and the President’s actions is that the
President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could
shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation.

1. The President Orders McGahn to Deny that the President Tried to Fire the
Special Counsel

Overview

In late January 2018, the media reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered
McGahn to have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but McGahn
had refused, saying he would quit instead. After the story broke, the President, through his
personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove
the Special Counsel. Each time he was approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute
the press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President’s effort to have the
Special Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahn in the Oval Office
with only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to say that the President never ordered
him to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn refused and insisted his memory of the President’s
direction to remove the Special Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting, the President
challenged McGahn for taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had
told Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed.

Evidence
1. The Press Reports that the President Tried to Fire the Special Counsel

On January 25, 2018, the New York Times reported that in June 2017, the President had
ordered McGahn to have the Department of Justice fire the Special Counsel.””” According to the
article, “[a]mid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible
obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that
disqualified him from overseeing the investigation.””® The article further reported that “[a]fter
receiving the president’s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel . . . refused to ask the
Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead.””” The article
stated that the president “ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to
resign rather than carry out the directive.”’®® After the article was published, the President

dismissed the story when asked about it by reporters, saying, “Fake news, folks. Fake news. A
typical New York Times fake story.””®!

The next day, the Washington Post reported on the same event but added that McGahn had
not told the President directly that he intended to resign rather than carry out the directive to have
the Special Counsel terminated.”®® In that respect, the Post story clarified the Times story, which
could be read to suggest that McGahn had told the President of his intention to quit, causing the
President to back down from the order to have the Special Counsel fired.”*?

2. The President Seeks to Have McGahn Dispute the Press Reports

On January 26, 2018, the President’s personal counsel called McGahn’s attorney and said
that the President wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to fire
the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest.”** McGahn’s attorney spoke with
McGahn about that request and then called the President’s personal counsel to relay that McGahn
would not make a statement.”® McGahn’s attorney informed the President’s personal counsel that
the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel
removed.”®® Accordingly, McGahn’s attorney said, although the article was inaccurate in some
other respects, McGahn could not comply with the President’s request to dispute the story.”®
Hicks recalled relaying to the President that one of his attorneys had spoken to McGahn’s attorney
about the issue.”®®

82 The Post article stated, “Despite internal objections, Trump decided to assert that Mueller had

said he would not remain at the White House if Trump went through with the move. . .. McGahn did not

Also on January 26, 2017, Hicks recalled that the President asked Sanders to contact
McGahn about the story.”® McGahn told Sanders there was no need to respond and indicated that
some of the article was accurate.””® Consistent with that position, McGahn did not correct the
Times story.

On February 4, 2018, Priebus appeared on Meet the Press and said he had not heard the
President say that he wanted the Special Counsel fired.”! After Priebus’s appearance, the
President called Priebus and said he did a great job on Meet the Press.””* The President also told
Priebus that the President had “never said any of those things about” the Special Counsel.”?

The next day, on February 5, 2018, the President complained about the Times article to
Porter.” The President told Porter that the article was “bullshit” and he had not sought to
terminate the Special Counsel.”” The President said that McGahn leaked to the media to make
himself look good.”® The President then directed Porter to tell McGahn to create a record to make
clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel.”” Porter thought the
matter should be handled by the White House communications office, but the President said he
wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file “for our records” and wanted something beyond a press
statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate.””® The President referred to McGahn
as a “lying bastard” and said that he wanted a record from him.”” Porter recalled the President

card dated February 5, 2018, Porter took notes that are consistent with his description of the discussion:
“COS: (1) Letter from DM — Never threatened to quit — DIT never told him to fire M.” SC_RRP000053

Don McGahn letter — Mueller + resigning.” WH000017684 (Kelly 2/5/18 Notes). Kelly said he did not
recall what the notes meant, but thought the President may have “mused” about having McGahn write a
letter. Kelly 8/2/18 302, at 3. McGahn recalled that Porter spoke with him about the President’s request
about two weeks after the New York Times story was published, which is consistent with the discussion
taking place on or about February 5. McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 4.

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s efforts to have McGahn deny that he had been ordered to have
the Special Counsel removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of
justice:

a. Obstructive act. The President’s repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record
denying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an
obstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn from testifying truthfully or to
undermine his credibility as a potential witness if he testified consistently with his memory, rather
than with what the record said.

There is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories
were published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong and that he had
never told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The President correctly
understood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he planned to resign. In addition,
the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and
in the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the President said, “I never said to fire Mueller. I never
said ‘fire.”” That evidence could indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade
McGahn to change his story but was instead offering his own—but different—recollection of the
substance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn'’s reaction to them.

Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President’s conduct. As previously
described, see Volume I1, Section IL.E, supra, substantial evidence supports McGahn’s account
that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed, including the timing and
context of the President’s directive; the manner in which McGahn reacted; and the fact that the
President had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department
of Justice, and should be raised with the President’s personal counsel rather than brought to
McGahn. In addition, the President’s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the
Special Counsel removed were carefully worded. When first asked about the New York Times
story, the President said, “Fake news, folks. Fake news. A typical New York Times fake story.”
And when the President spoke with McGahn in the Oval Office, he focused on whether he had
used the word “fire,” saying, “I never said to fire Mueller. I never said ‘fire’” and “Did I say the
word ‘fire’?” The President’s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the evidence.

In addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn’s memory of the June
17, 2017 events, the evidence indicates that the President knew by the time of the Oval Office

meeting that McGahn’s account differed and that McGahn was firm in his views. Shortly after the
story broke, the President’s counsel told McGahn’s counsel that the President wanted McGahn to
make a statement denying he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded
through his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply
with the President’s request. . The President then directed Sanders to tell McGahn to correct the
story, but McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in reporting on the
President’s order. Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a correction. More than a
week later, the President brought up the issue again with Porter, made comments indicating the
President thought McGahn had leaked the story, and directed Porter to have McGahn create a
record denying that the President had tried to fire the Special Counsel. At that point, the President
said he might “have to get rid of* McGahn if McGahn did not comply. McGahn again refused and
told Porter, as he had told Sanders and as his counsel had told the President’s counsel, that the
President had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. That evidence
indicates that by the time of the Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not
think the story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record denying
facts that McGahn believed to be true. The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to
repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. By January 2018, the Special Counsel’s use of a
grand jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President also
was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating obstruction-related events because, among
other reasons, on January 8, 2018, the Special Counsel’s Office provided his counsel with a
detailed list of topics for a possible interview with the President.*®® The President knew that
McGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the Special Counsel was investigating and
that McGahn had already been interviewed by Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval
Office meeting, the President indicated he knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel’s
Office about the President’s effort to remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged
McGahn for disclosing that information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating
unnecessary legal exposure. That evidence indicates the President’s awareness that the June 17,
2017 events were relevant to the Special Counsel’s investigation and any grand jury investigation
that might grow out of it.

To establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President’s actions would have
the natural tendency to affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or prevent the
communication of information to investigators. Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel
investigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seeking to influence his prior
statements in those interviews. But because McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and
the obstruction inquiry was not complete, it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again
on obstruction-related topics. If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking
to have McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to further
investigative interviews would not be shown. But the President’s efforts to have McGahn write a
letter “for our records” approximately ten days after the stories had come out—well past the typical

 

830 1/29/18 Letter, President’s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel’s Office, at 1-2 (“In our
conversation of January 8, your office identified the following topics as areas you desired to address with
the President in order to complete your investigation on the subjects of alleged collusion and obstruction of
justice”; listing 16 topics).

time to issue a correction for a news story—indicates the President was not focused solely on a
press strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings
arising from it.

& Intent. Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute
that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of
influencing McGahn’s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President’s
conduct towards the investigation.

Several facts support that conclusion. The President made repeated attempts to get
McGahn to change his story. As described above, by the time of the last attempt, the evidence
suggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President
had ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated. McGahn interpreted his encounter with
the President in the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he was to
his memory of what had occurred. The President had already laid the groundwork for pressing
McGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might be necessary to fire McGahn if he did
not deny the story, and Porter relayed that statement to McGahn. Additional evidence of the
President’s intent may be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the
prospect of the President’s meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn’s counsel and said that
MecGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the Oval Office that day. The President’s
counsel was well aware of McGahn’s resolve not to issue what he believed to be a false account
of events despite the President’s request. Finally, as noted above, the President brought up the
Special Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahn and criticized him for
telling this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President’s statements reflect his
understanding—and his displeasure—that those events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice

inquiry.
J. The President’s Conduct Towards Flynn, Manafort,m
Overview

In addition to the interactions with McGahn described above, the President has taken other
actions directed at possible witnesses in the Special Counsel’s investigation, including Flynn,
Manafort,mand as described in the next section, Cohen. When Flynn withdrew from a joint
defense agreement with the President, the President’s personal counsel stated that Flynn’s actions
would be viewed as reflecting “hostility” towards the President. During Manafort’s prosecution
and while the jury was deliberating, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort was being treated
unfairly and made it known that Manafort could receive a pardon. [EEITURINCNTIIRITRIENEN

     
 

   

Evidence

1. Conduct Directed at Michael Flynn
As previously noted, see Volume II, Section I1.B, supra, the President asked for Flynn’s

resignation on February 13, 2017. Following Flynn’s resignation, the President made positive
public comments about Flynn, describing him as a “wonderful man,” “a fine person,” and a “very

good person.”®*! The President also privately asked advisors to pass messages to Flynn conveying
that the President still cared about him and encouraging him to stay strong.**

In late November 2017, Flynn began to cooperate with this Office. On November 22,2017,
Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement he had with the President.¥* Flynn’s counsel told
the President’s personal counsel and counsel for the White House that Flynn could no longer have
confidential communications with the White House or the President.*** Later that night, the
President’s personal counsel left a voicemail for Flynn’s counsel that said:

I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms. ... [I]t
wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with . .. the government. ... [I]f
. . . there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security
issue, ... so, you know, ... we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of
protecting all our interests if we can. ... [R]emember what we’ve always said about the
‘President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains . . . .*%°

On November 23, 2017, Flynn’s attorneys returned the call from the President’s personal
counsel to acknowledge receipt of the voicemail *® Flynn’s attorneys reiterated that they were no
longer in a position to share information under any sort of privilege.*” According to Flynn’s
attorneys, the President’s personal counsel was indignant and vocal in his disagreement.*® The
President’s personal counsel said that he interpreted what they said to him as a reflection of Flynn’s

a tweet).

Flynn’s attorneys understood that statement to be an attempt to make them reconsider their position
because the President’s personal counsel believed that Flynn would be disturbed to know that such
a message would be conveyed to the President,*°

On December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements pursuant to a
cooperation agreement.®*! The next day, the President told the press that he was not concerned
about what Flynn might tell the Special Counsel.®** In response to a question about whether the
President still stood behind Flynn, the President responded, “We’ll see what happens.”®* Over
the next several days, the President made public statements expressing sympathy for Flynn and
indicating he had not been treated fairly.%** On December 15, 2017, the President responded to a
press inquiry about whether he was considering a pardon for Flynn by saying, “I don’t want to talk
about pardons for Michael Flynn yet. We’ll see what happens. Let’s see. [ can say this: When

In January 2018, Manafort told Gates that he had talked to the President’s personal counsel

years. Like Manafort has nothing to do with our campaign. But I feel so—I tell you, I feel a little
badly about it. They went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago? ... I feel badly
for some people, because they’ve gone back 12 years to find things about somebody, and T don’t
think it’s right.”®* In response to a question about whether he was considering a pardon for
Manafort or other individuals involved in the Special Counsel’s investigation, the President said,
“] don’t want to talk about that. No, I don’t want to talk about that. . . . But look, I do want to see
people treated fairly. That’s what it’s all about.” *** Hours later, Manafort’s bail was revoked and

Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn’t know
Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all the others?
Very unfair!”8

Immediately following the revocation of Manafort’s bail, the President’s personal lawyer,
Rudolph Giuliani, gave a series of interviews in which he raised the possibility of a pardon for
Manafort. Giuliani told the New York Daily News that “[w]hen the whole thing is over, things
might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.”®*® Giuliani also said in an interview that,
although the President should not pardon anyone while the Special Counsel’s investigation was
ongoing, “when the investigation is concluded, he’s kind of on his own, right?”®’ In a CNN
interview two days later, Giuliani said, “T guess I should clarify this once and for all. . . . The
president has issued no pardons in this investigation. The president is not going to issue pardons
in this investigation. . . . When it’s over, hey, he’s the president of the United States. He retains
his pardon power. Nobody is taking that away from him.”®*® Giuliani rejected the suggestion that
his and the President’s comments could signal to defendants that they should not cooperate in a
criminal prosecution because a pardon might follow, saying the comments were “certainly not
intended that way.”®*® Giuliani said the comments only acknowledged that an individual involved
in the investigation would not be “excluded from [a pardon], if in fact the president and his advisors

were not unusual in political investigations but said, “That doesn’t mean they’re going to happen

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, w, the following
evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice:

a. Obstructive act. The President’s actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel’s
investigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to prevent particular
witnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing,
delaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement.

With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging
him to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him before he began to
cooperate with the government. When Flynn’s attorneys withdrew him from a joint defense
agreement with the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially cooperating with the
government, the President’s personal counsel initially reminded Flynn’s counsel of the President’s
warm feelings towards Flynn and said “that still remains.” But when Flynn’s counsel reiterated
that Flynn could no longer share information under a joint defense agreement, the President’s
personal counsel stated that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn’s hostility
towards the President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn’s
decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues,
however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about
the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn’s counsel.

With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President’s actions had the potential to
influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government. The President and his
personal counsel made repeated statements suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Manafort,
while also making it clear that the President did not want Manafort to “flip” and cooperate with
the government. On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort’s D.C. case was
considering whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he “felt badly” for Manafort and
stated, “I think a lot of it is very unfair.” And when asked about a pardon for Manafort, the
President said, “I do want to see people treated fairly. That’s what it’s all about.” Later that day,
after Manafort’s bail was revoked, the President called it a “tough sentence” that was “Very
unfair!” Two days later, the President’s personal counsel stated that individuals involved in the
Special Counsel’s investigation could receive a pardon “if in fact the [P]resident and his advisors
... come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly”—using language that paralleled
how the President had already described the treatment of Manafort. Those statements, combined
with the President’s commendation of Manafort for being a “brave man” who “refused to ‘break’,”
suggested that a pardon was a more likely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate with
the government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation
agreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to investigators.

The President’s public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury
deliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second day of trial, for
example, the President called the prosecution a “terrible situation” and a “hoax” that “continues to
stain our country” and referred to Manafort as a “Reagan/Dole darling” who was “serving solitary
confinement” even though he was “convicted of nothing.” Those statements were widely picked
up by the press. While jurors were instructed not to watch or read news stories about the case and

131


==================== PAGE 345 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WorkProduet // Mey-ContatnMaterial Proteeted-UnderFed—R—Crim-—P—6(e)

are presumed to follow those instructions, the President’s statements during the trial generated
substantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if they happened to see the statements
or learned about them from others. And the President’s statements during jury deliberations that
Manafort “happens to be a very good person” and that “it’s very sad what they’ve done to Paul
Manafort” had the potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements, which the President
made just as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit Manafort.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. The President’s actions towards Flynn, Manafort,

appear to have been connected to pending or anticipated official proceedings involving

each individual. The President’s conduct towards Flynnw principally occurred when both

were under criminal investigation by the Special Counsel’s Office and press reports speculated

about whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel’s investigation. And the President’s

conduct towards Manafort was directly connected to the official proceedings involving him. The

President made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort’s criminal

trial. And the President’s comments about the prospect of Manafort “flipping” occurred when it
was clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings.

 

g, Intent. Evidence concerning the President’s intent related to Flynn as a potential
witness is inconclusive. As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have evidence
establishing whether the President knew about or was involved in his counsel’s communications
with Flynn’s counsel stating that Flynn’s decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement
and cooperate with the government would be viewed as reflecting “hostility” towards the
President. And regardless of what the President’s personal counsel communicated, the President
continued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation
agreement, stating that Flynn had “led a very strong life” and the President “fe[lt] very badly”
about what had happened to him.

Evidence concerning the President’s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President
intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before Manafort was
convicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated unfairly. One day after
Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially faced a lengthy prison term, the
President said that Manafort was “a brave man” for refusing to “break’ and that “flipping” “almost
ought to be outlawed.” At the same time, although the President had privately told aides he did
not like Manafort, he publicly called Manafort “a good man” and said he had a “wonderful family.”
And when the President was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the
President did not respond directly and instead said he had “great respect for what [Manafort]’s
done, in terms of what he’s gone through.” The President added that “some of the charges they
threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.” In light of the
President’s counsel’s previous statements that the investigations “might get cleaned up with some
presidential pardons” and that a pardon would be possible if the President “come[s] to the
conclusion that you have been treated unfairly,” the evidence supports the inference that the

132


==================== PAGE 346 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WorkProduet // May-Contain-Materiat-Proteeted-UndertedR-Crim—P—6(e)

President intended Manafort to believe that he could receive a pardon, which would make
cooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary.

We also examined the evidence of the President’s intent in making public statements about
Manafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating. Some evidence supports
a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence the jury. The trial generated
widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators suggested that an acquittal
would add to pressure to end the Special Counsel’s investigation. By publicly stating on the second
day of deliberations that Manafort “happens to be a very good person” and that “it’s very sad what
they’ve done to Paul Manafort” right after calling the Special Counsel’s investigation a “rigged
witch hunt,” the President’s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural tendency to
engender sympathy for Manafort among jurors, and a factfinder could infer that the President
intended that result. But there are alternative explanations for the President’s comments, including
that he genuinely felt sorry for Manafort or that his goal was not to influence the jury but to
influence public opinion. The President’s comments also could have been intended to continue
sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible. As described above, the President
made his comments about Manafort being “a very good person” immediately after declining to
answer a question about whether he would pardon Manafort.

K. The President’s Conduct Involving Michael Cohen
Overview

The President’s conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our
investigation. During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf
of the Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times,
including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the media
began questioning Trump’s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a “party line” that publicly
distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen continued to adhere
to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its
Russia investigation. In an attempt to minimize the President’s connections to Russia, Cohen
submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower
Moscow project three times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen
had not received a response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project
ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While working on the
congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President’s personal counsel,
who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the
statement short and “tight.” After the FBI searched Cohen’s home and office in April 2018, the
President publicly asserted that Cohen would not “flip” and privately passed messages of support
to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President’s personal counsel and believed that if
he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do “something else” to make
the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the
President publicly criticized him, called him a “rat,” and suggested his family members had
committed crimes.

Evidence

1. Candidate Trump’s Awareness of and Involvement in the Trump Tower
Moscow Project

The President’s interactions with Cohen as a witness took place against the background of
the President’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project.

As described in detail in Volume I, Section IV.A.1, supra, from September 2015 until at
least June 2016, the Trump Organization pursued a Trump Tower Moscow project in Russia, with
negotiations conducted by Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and
special counsel to Donald J. Trump.”” The Trump Organization had previously and

 

9 In August 2018 and November 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple crimes of deception,
including making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, as described later
in this section. When Cohen first met with investigators from this Office, he repeated the same lies he told
Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project. Cohen 8/7/18 302, at [2-17. But after Cohen pleaded
guilty to offenses in the Southern District of New York on August 21, 2018, he met with investigators again
and corrected the record. The Office found Cohen’s testimony in these subsequent proffer sessions to be
consistent with and corroborated by other information obtained in the course of the Office’s investigation.
The Office’s sentencing submission in Cohen’s criminal case stated: “Starting with his second meeting with
the [Special Counsel’s Office] in September 2018, the defendant has accepted responsibility not only for

unsuccessfully pursued a building project in Moscow.”'® According to Cohen, in approximately
September 2015 he obtained internal approval from Trump to negotiate on behalf of the Trump
Organization to have a Russian corporation build a tower in Moscow that licensed the Trump name
and brand.?"" Cohen thereafter had numerous brief conversations with Trump about the project.”'?
Cohen recalled that Trump wanted to be updated on any developments with Trump Tower Moscow

recalled briefing Donald Trump Jr. in the spring—a conversation that Cohen said was not “idle
chit chat” because Trump Tower Moscow was potentially a $1 billion deal.”

Cohen recalled that around May 2016, he again raised with candidate Trump the possibility
of a trip to Russia to advance the Trump Tower Moscow project.””' At that time, Cohen had
received several texts from Sater seeking to arrange dates for such a trip.”** On May 4, 2016, Sater
wrote to Cohen, “I had a chat with Moscow. ASSUMING the trip does happen the question is
before or after the convention. . . .. Obviously the premeeting trip (you only) can happen anytime
you want but the 2 big guys [is] the question. I said I would confirm and revert.”>> Cohen
responded, “My trip before Cleveland. Trump once he becomes the nominee after the
convention.” On May 5, 2016, Sater followed up with a text that Cohen thought he probably
read to Trump:

Peskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum which is
Russia’s Davos it’s June 16-19. He wants to meet there with you and possibly
introduce you to either Putin or Medvedev. ... This is perfect. The entire business
class of Russia will be there as well. He said anything you want to discuss including
dates and subjects are on the table to discuss.”

Cohen recalled discussing the invitation to the St. Petersburg Economic Forum with
candidate Trump and saying that Putin or Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev might be
there.”*® Cohen remembered that Trump said that he would be willing to travel to Russia if Cohen
could “lock and load” on the deal.?*” In June 2016, Cohen decided not to attend the St. Petersburg
Economic Forum because Sater had not obtained a formal invitation for Cohen from Peskov.”*®
Cohen said he had a quick conversation with Trump at that time but did not tell him that the project
was over because he did not want Trump to complain that the deal was on-again-off-again if it
were revived.”*

During the summer of 2016, Cohen recalled that candidate Trump publicly claimed that he
had nothing to do with Russia and then shortly afterwards privately checked with Cohen about the
status of the Trump Tower Moscow project, which Cohen found “interesting.”**® At some point

that summer, Cohen recalled having a brief conversation with Trump in which Cohen said the
Trump Tower Moscow project was going nowhere because the Russian development company
had not secured a piece of property for the project.”*! Trump said that was “too bad,” and Cohen
did not recall talking with Trump about the project after that.”** Cohen said that at no time during
the campaign did Trump tell him not to pursue the project or that the project should be
abandoned.”®

2. Cohen Determines to Adhere to a “Party Line” Distancing Candidate Trump
From Russia

As previously discussed, see Volume II, Section I1.A, supra, when questions about possible
Russian support for candidate Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump
denied having any personal, financial, or business connection to Russia, which Cohen described
as the “party line” or “message” to follow for Trump and his senior advisors.***

After the election, the Trump Organization sought to formally close out certain deals in
advance of the inauguration.”® Cohen recalled that Trump Tower Moscow was on the list of deals
to be closed out.”*® In approximately January 2017, Cohen began receiving inquiries from the
media about Trump Tower Moscow, and he recalled speaking to the President-Elect when those
inquiries came in.**’ Cohen was concerned that truthful answers about the Trump Tower Moscow
project might not be consistent with the “message” that the President-Elect had no relationship
with Russia.**®

In an effort to “stay on message,” Cohen told a New York Times reporter that the Trump
Tower Moscow deal was not feasible and had ended in January 2016.**° Cohen recalled that this
was part of a “script” or talking points he had developed with President-Elect Trump and others to

dismiss the idea of a substantial connection between Trump and Russia.”® Cohen said that he
discussed the talking points with Trump but that he did not explicitly tell Trump he thought they
were untrue because Trump already knew they were untrue.”' Cohen thought it was important to
say the deal was done in January 2016, rather than acknowledge that talks continued in May and
June 2016, because it limited the period when candidate Trump could be alleged to have a
relationship with Russia to an early point in the campaign, before Trump had become the party’s
presumptive nominee.”*?

3. Cohen Submits False Statements to Congress Minimizing the Trump Tower
Moscow Project in Accordance with the Party Line

In early May 2017, Cohen received requests from Congress to provide testimony and
documents in connection with congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016
election.®”® At that time, Cohen understood Congress’s interest in him to be focused on the
allegations in the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russian officials
in Prague during the campaign.”* Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned
about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.”*® On May 18, 2017, Cohen met
with the President to discuss the request from Congress, and the President instructed Cohen that
he should cooperate because there was nothing there.”®

Cohen eventually entered into a joint defense agreement (JDA) with the President and other
individuals who were part of the Russia investigation.””” In the months leading up to his
congressional testimony, Cohen frequently spoke with the President’s personal counsel.”® Cohen

conversations with the President’s personal counsel after waiving any privilege of his own and after this
Office advised his counsel not to provide any communications that would be covered by any other privilege,
including communications protected by a joint defense or common interest privilege. As a result, most of
what Cohen told us about his conversations with the President’s personal counsel concerned what Cohen
had communicated to the President’s personal counsel, and not what was said in response. Cohen described
certain statements made by the President’s personal counsel, however, that are set forth in this section.
Cohen and his counsel were better positioned than this Office to evaluate whether any privilege protected
those statements because they had knowledge of the scope of their joint defense agreement and access to
privileged communications that may have provided context for evaluating the statements they shared. After
interviewing Cohen about these matters, we asked the President’s personal counsel if he wished to provide
information to us about his conversations with Cohen related to Cohen’s congressional testimony about

said that in those conversations the President’s personal counsel would sometimes say that he had
just been with the President.”® Cohen recalled that the President’s personal counsel told him the
JDA was working well together and assured him that there was nothing there and if they stayed on
message the investigations would come to an end soon.”®® At that time, Cohen’s legal bills were
being paid by the Trump Organization,”' and Cohen was told not to worry because the
investigations would be over by summer or fall of 2017.°> Cohen said that the President’s
personal counsel also conveyed that, as part of the JDA, Cohen was protected, which he would not
be if he “went rogue.”®* Cohen recalled that the President’s personal counsel reminded him that
“the President loves you™ and told him that if he stayed on message, the President had his back.”**

In August 2017, Cohen began drafting a statement about Trump Tower Moscow to submit
to Congress along with his document production.’® The final version of the statement contained
several false statements about the project.”®® First, although the Trump Organization continued to
pursue the project until at least June 2016, the statement said, “The proposal was under
consideration at the Trump Organization from September 2015 until the end of January 2016. By
the end of January 2016, I determined that the proposal was not feasible for a variety of business
reasons and should not be pursued further. Based on my business determinations, the Trump
Organization abandoned the proposal.””®” Second, although Cohen and candidate Trump had
discussed possible travel to Russia by Trump to pursue the venture, the statement said, “Despite
overtures by Mr. Sater, I never considered asking Mr. Trump to travel to Russia in connection with
this proposal. I told Mr. Sater that Mr. Trump would not travel to Russia unless there was a
definitive agreement in place.”®® Third, although Cohen had regularly briefed Trump on the status

 

Trump Tower Moscow. The President’s personal counsel declined and, through his own counsel, indicated
that he could not disaggregate information he had obtained from Cohen from information he had obtained
from other parties in the JDA. Tn view of the admonition this Office gave to Cohen’s counsel to withhold
communications that could be covered by privilege, the President’s personal counsel’s uncertainty about
the provenance of his own knowledge, the burden on a privilege holder to establish the elements to support
a claim of privilege, and the substance of the statements themselves, we have included relevant statements
Cohen provided in this report. If the statements were to be used in a context beyond this report, further
analysis could be warranted.

Putin meeting when he testified before Congress because he had talked about the potential meeting
on Sean Hannity’s radio show.”® Cohen recalled explaining to the President’s personal counsel
the “whole story” of the attempt to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin and Trump’s role
in it.”®! Cohen recalled that he and the President’s personal counsel talked about keeping Trump
out of the narrative, and the President’s personal counsel told Cohen the story was not relevant and
should not be included in his statement to Congress.”®?

Cohen said that his “agenda” in submitting the statement to Congress with false
representations about the Trump Tower Moscow project was to minimize links between the project
and the President, give the false impression that the project had ended before the first presidential
primaries, and shut down further inquiry into Trump Tower Moscow, with the aim of limiting the
ongoing Russia investigations.”®® Cohen said he wanted to protect the President and be loyal to
him by not contradicting anything the President had said.”** Cohen recalled he was concerned that
if he told the truth about getting a response from the Kremlin or speaking to candidate Trump about
travel to Russia to pursue the project, he would contradict the message that no connection existed
between Trump and Russia, and he rationalized his decision to provide false testimony because
the deal never happened.”® He was not concerned that the story would be contradicted by
individuals who knew it was false because he was sticking to the party line adhered to by the whole
group.”®® Cohen wanted the support of the President and the White House, and he believed that

conversation and previous conversations about pardons with the President’s personal counsel that
as long as he stayed on message, he would be taken care of by the President, either through a
pardon or through the investigation being shut down.'**

On April 24, 2018, the President responded to a reporter’s inquiry whether he would
consider a pardon for Cohen with, “Stupid question.”'® On June 8, 2018, the President said he
“hadn’t even thought about” pardons for Manafort or Cohen, and continued, “It’s far too early to
be thinking about that. They haven’t been convicted of anything. There’s nothing to pardon.”'*¢
And on June 15, 2018, the President expressed sympathy for Cohen, Manafort, and Flynn in a
press interview and said, “I feel badly about a lot of them, because I think a lot of it is very
unfair.”1937

5. The President’s Conduct After Cohen Began Cooperating with the Government

On July 2, 2018, ABC News reported based on an “exclusive” interview with Cohen that
Cohen “strongly signaled his willingness to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller and
federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York—even if that puts President Trump in
jeopardy.”'%® That week, the media reported that Cohen had added an attorney to his legal team
who previously had worked as a legal advisor to President Bill Clinton.'**

Beginning on July 20, 2018, the media reported on the existence of a recording Cohen had
made of a conversation he had with candidate Trump about a payment made to a second woman
who said she had had an affair with Trump.'® On July 21, 2018, the President responded:
“Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning)—
almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client—totally unheard
of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!”'"**' On
July 27, 2018, after the media reported that Cohen was willing to inform investigators that Donald
Trump Jr. told his father about the June 9, 2016 meeting to get “dirt” on Hillary Clinton,'™** the
President tweeted: “[S]o the Fake News doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions, NO, I did
NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up

and Crooked Hillary’s lawyer. Gee, [ wonder if they helped him make the choice!”'**?

On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to eight
felony charges, including two counts of campaign-finance violations based on the payments he
had made during the final weeks of the campaign to women who said they had affairs with the
President.'®* During the plea hearing, Cohen stated that he had worked “at the direction of” the
candidate in making those payments.'® The next day, the President contrasted Cohen’s
cooperation with Manafort’s refusal to cooperate, tweeting, “I feel very badly for Paul Manafort
and his wonderful family. ‘Justice’ took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied
tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to ‘break’—make up stories
in order to get a ‘deal.’” Such respect for a brave man!”1%46

On September 17, 2018, this Office submitted written questions to the President that
included questions about the Trump Tower Moscow project and attached Cohen’s written
statement to Congress and the Letter of Intent signed by the President.’®” Among other issues,
the questions asked the President to describe the timing and substance of discussions he had with
Cohen about the project, whether they discussed a potential trip to Russia, and whether the
President “at any time direct[ed] or suggest[ed] that discussions about the Trump Moscow project
should cease,” or whether the President was “informed at any time that the project had been
abandoned.”'®*

On November 20, 2018, the President submitted written responses that did not answer those
questions about Trump Tower Moscow directly and did not provide any information about the
timing of the candidate’s discussions with Cohen about the project or whether he participated in
any discussions about the project being abandoned or no longer pursued.'®® Instead, the
President’s answers stated in relevant part:

I had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject. As I recall, they were brief, and
they were not memorable. T was not enthused about the proposal, and I do not recall any
discussion of travel to Russia in connection with it. I do not remember discussing it with

On November 29, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress
based on his statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project.'®! In a plea agreement with this
Office, Cohen agreed to “provide truthful information regarding any and all matters as to which
this Office deems relevant.”'%%? Later on November 29, after Cohen’s guilty plea had become
public, the President spoke to reporters about the Trump Tower Moscow project, saying:

[ decided not to do the project. . . . I decided ultimately not to do it. There would have
been nothing wrong if I did do it. IfTdid do it, there would have been nothing wrong. That
was my business. . .. It was an option that I decided not to do. . . . I decided not to do it.
The primary reason . . . | was focused on running for President. . . . I was running my
business while I was campaigning. There was a good chance that | wouldn’t have won, in
which case | would’ve gone back into the business. And why should T lose lots of
opportunities?'®**

The President also said that Cohen was “a weak person. And by being weak, unlike other people
that you watch—he is a weak person. And what he’s trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So
he’s lying about a project that everybody knew about.”'%* The President also brought up Cohen’s
written submission to Congress regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project: “So here’s the story:
Go back and look at the paper that Michael Cohen wrote before he testified in the House and/or
Senate. It talked about his position.”'®> The President added, “Even if [Cohen] was right, it
doesn’t matter because I was allowed to do whatever [ wanted during the campaign.”'%

In light of the President’s public statements following Cohen’s guilty plea that he “decided
not to do the project,” this Office again sought information from the President about whether he
participated in any discussions about the project being abandoned or no longer pursued, including
when he “decided not to do the project,” who he spoke to about that decision, and what motivated

In the weeks following Cohen’s plea and agreement to provide assistance to this Office,
the President repeatedly implied that Cohen’s family members were guilty of crimes. On
December 3, 2018, after Cohen had filed his sentencing memorandum, the President tweeted,
“‘Michael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time.” You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE,
unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long
prison term? He makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and
get his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and
should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.”!%* Harm to Ongoing Matter

   

On December 12, 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.'? The next
day, the President sent a series of tweets that said: :

I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law. . .. Those charges were just agreed to by
him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he
did—including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer,
Michael has great liability to me!'%

On December 16, 2018, the President tweeted, “Remember, Michael Cohen only became a ‘Rat’
after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt
was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE! Why didn’t they break
into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked’s office?”1%%

was asked whether he was worried about Cohen’s testimony and responded:

[[]n order to get his sentence reduced, [Cohen] says “I have an idea, I’ll ah, tell—I’Il give
you some information on the president.” Well, there is no information. But ke should give
information maybe on his father-in-law because that’s the one that people want to look at
because where does that money—that’s the money in the family. And I guess he didn’t
want to talk about his father-in-law, he’s trying to get his sentence reduced. So it’s ah,
pretty sad. You know, it’s weak and it’s very sad to watch a thing like that.'"®

On January 18, 2019, the President tweeted, “Kevin Corke, @FoxNews ‘Don’t forget,

Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars. . . .” Lying

Also in January 2019, Giuliani gave press interviews that appeared to confirm Cohen’s
account that the Trump Organization pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project well past January
2016. Giuliani stated that “it’s our understanding that [discussions about the Trump Moscow
project] went on throughout 2016. Weren’t a lot of them, but there were conversations. Can’t be
sure of the exact date. But the president can remember having conversations with him about it.

November.”'% In an interview with the New York Times, Giuliani quoted the President as saying
that the discussions regarding the Trump Moscow project were “going on from the day [
announced to the day T won.”'%"® On January 21, 2019, Giuliani issued a statement that said: “My

Analysis

In analyzing the President’s conduct related to Cohen, the following evidence is relevant
to the elements of obstruction of justice.

a. Obstructive act. We gathered evidence of the President’s conduct related to Cohen
on two issues: (i) whether the President or others aided or participated in Cohen’s false statements
to Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to
prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government.

1. First, with regard to Cohen’s false statements to Congress, while there is
evidence, described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress
about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the evidence available to us does not establish that the
President directed or aided Cohen’s false testimony.

Cohen said that his statements to Congress followed a “party line” that developed within
the campaign to align with the President’s public statements distancing the President from Russia.
Cohen also recalled that, in speaking with the President in advance of testifying, he made it clear
that he would stay on message—which Cohen believed they both understood would require false
testimony. But Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s
testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did
not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the
specifics of his planned testimony. During the time when his statement to Congress was being
drafted and circulated to members of the JDA, Cohen did not speak directly to the President about
the statement, but rather communicated with the President’s personal counsel—as corroborated by
phone records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President’s personal
counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before Congress.

Cohen recalled that in his discussions with the President’s personal counsel on August 27,
2017—the day before Cohen’s statement was submitted to Congress—Cohen said that there were
more communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the
statement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time. According to Cohen,
the President’s personal counsel—who did not have first-hand knowledge of the project—
responded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water, that it was unnecessary to include
those details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short
and tight, not elaborate, stay on message, and not contradict the President. Cohen’s recollection
of the content of those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen’s
draft statement that appeared to come from members of the JDA. For example, Cohen omitted
any reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to set up a meeting between Trump
and Putin during the United Nations General Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a decision of

Office].” 2/6/19 Letter, President’s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel’s Office.

the JDA to delete the sentence, “The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian
government officials.”

The President’s personal counsel declined to provide us with his account of his
conversations with Cohen, and there is no evidence available to us that indicates that the President
was aware of the information Cohen provided to the President’s personal counsel. The President’s
conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-client privilege,
and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications. The absence of evidence
about the President and his counsel’s conversations about the drafting of Cohen’s statement
precludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played.

ii. Second, we considered whether the President took actions that would have
the natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal
investigators or to Congress.

Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately
urged Cohen to stay on message and not “flip.” Cohen recalled the President’s personal counsel
telling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go “rogue.” In the days and weeks
that followed the April 2018 searches of Cohen’s home and office, the President told reporters that
Cohen was a “good man” and said he was “a fine person with a wonderful family . . . who I have
always liked & respected.” Privately, the President told Cohen to “hang in there” and “stay
strong.” People who were close to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohen that
“the President loves you,” “the boss loves you,” and “everyone knows the boss has your back.”
Through the President’s personal counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen “thanks
for what you do” after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that,
according to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew was false. At that time, the Trump
Organization continued to pay Cohen’s legal fees, which was important to Cohen. Cohen also
recalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the President’s personal counsel, who told him
to stay on message and everything would be fine. The President indicated in his public statements
that a pardon had not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that “[m]ost people will flip if the
Government lets them out of trouble” but that he “d[idn’t] see Michael doing that.”

After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however, the
President accused Cohen of “mak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam
(Taxi cabs maybe?),” called Cohen a “rat,” and on multiple occasions publicly suggested that
Cohen’s family members had committed crimes. The evidence concerning this sequence of events
could support an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages
in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the
provision of information or undermine Cohen’s credibility once Cohen began cooperating.

b. Nexus to an official proceeding. The President’s relevant conduct towards Cohen
occurred when the President knew the Special Counsel’s Office, Congress, and the U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the Southern District of New York were investigating Cohen’s conduct. The President
acknowledged through his public statements and tweets that Cohen potentially could cooperate
with the government investigations.

154


==================== PAGE 368 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney-WorlProduet // May-Contain-Material-Proteoted-Under-Fed—R—Crim—P—6(e)

e Intent. In analyzing the President’s intent in his actions towards Cohen as a
potential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to
discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen’s information would shed
adverse light on the President’s campaign-period conduct and statements.

i. Cohen’s false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow
project was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit
the congressional and DOJ Russia investigations—a goal that was in the President’s interest, as
reflected by the President’s own statements. During and after the campaign, the President made
repeated statements that he had “no business” in Russia and said that there were “no deals that
could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away.” As Cohen knew, and as he recalled
communicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen’s pursuit of the Trump Tower
Moscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these statements.

In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with
candidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscow project, that the
conversations continued through at least June 2016, and that he discussed with Trump possible
travel to Russia to pursue the project. The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen,
because the project had the potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from
Cohen and other records further establish that Cohen’s efforts to advance the project did not end
in January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the timing for possible
trips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the project.

The evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at the
time of Cohen’s false statements to Congress. Cohen discussed the project with the President in
early 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after
he released to the public his opening remarks to Congress—which said the project “was terminated
in January of 2016”—the President’s personal counsel told him the President was pleased with
what Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow. And after Cohen’s guilty plea, the President
told reporters that he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which supports the inference
that he remained aware of his own involvement in the project and the period during the Campaign
in which the project was being pursued.

ii. The President’s public remarks following Cohen’s guilty plea also suggest
that the President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump
Tower Moscow project. At the time the President submitted written answers to questions from
this Office about the project and other subjects, the media had reported that Cohen was cooperating
with the government but Cohen had not yet pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress.
Accordingly, it was not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided
to the government. In his writien answers, the President did not provide details about the timing
and substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no indication that he had
decided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly
stated that he had personally made the decision to abandon the project. The President then declined
to clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content and
timing of the President’s provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the
Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concerned about the
information that Cohen could provide as a witness.

155


==================== PAGE 369 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney-WorkProduet / May-Contain-MaterialProteeted-UnderFed-R—Crim—P6(e)

iil. The President’s concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed
at the Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the President’s dealings
with Cohen rather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow. There also is some evidence
that the President’s concern about Cohen cooperating was based on the President’s stated belief
that Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in an attempt to obtain a lesser
sentence for his unrelated criminal conduct. The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen,
refused to “break’ and “make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.”” And after Cohen pleaded guilty
to making false statements to Congress, the President said, “what [Cohen]’s trying to do is get a
reduced sentence. So he’s lying about a project that everybody knew about.” But the President
also appeared to defend the underlying conduct, saying, “Even if [Cohen] was right, it doesn’t
matter because I was allowed to do whatever [ wanted during the campaign.” As described above,
there is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump
Tower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect the President and minimize the President’s
connections to Russia during the campaign.

iv. Finally, the President’s statements insinuating that members of Cohen’s
family committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed as
an effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen
or others. It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen “mald]e[]
up stories” in order to get a deal for himself and “get his wife and father-in-law . . . off Scott Free.”
It also is possible that the President’s mention of Cohen’s wife and father-in-law were not intended
to affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy aimed at discrediting
Cohen and deflecting attention away from the President on Cohen-related matters. But the
President’s suggestion that Cohen’s family members committed crimes happened more than once,
including just before Cohen was sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen
“should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence”) and again just before Cohen was
scheduled to testify before Congress. The timing of the statements supports an inference that they
were intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from further cooperation.

L. Overarching Factual Issues

Although this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination
decision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts
concerning the President’s course of conduct.

1. Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland obstruction-of-
justice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice.

First, the conduct involved actions by the President. Some of the conduct did not implicate
the President’s constitutional authority and raises garden-variety obstruction-of-justice issues.
Other events we investigated, however, drew upon the President’s Article II authority, which
raised constitutional issues that we address in Volume II, Section IIL.B, infra. A factual analysis
of that conduct would have to take into account both that the President’s acts were facially lawful
and that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and powerful
means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses.

Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying
crime. Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper
obstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that
he contemplated an effect on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d
558, 591 (2d Cir. 2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction offense.
See United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017) (stating, in applying the obstruction
sentencing guideline, that “obstruction of a criminal investigation is punishable even if the
prosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying
crime’). Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal
interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area,
or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same
regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.

In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an
underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range
of other possible personal motives animating the President’s conduct. These include concerns that
continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential
uncertainty about whether certain events—such as advance notice of Wikil.eaks’s release of
hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians—
could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.

Third, many of the President’s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of
cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public
view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a
corrupt intent, the President’s power to influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his
unique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications. And no principle of law
excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to
intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony, the justice system’s integrity is equally threatened.

2. Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts—e.g., the President’s
statement to Comey about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Comey, and his efforts to
remove the Special Counsel—it is important to view the President’s pattern of conduct as a whole.
That pattern sheds light on the nature of the President’s acts and the inferences that can be drawn
about his intent.

a. Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting
undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and
obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in
which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions
ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney
General’s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to
direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony. Viewing
the acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance. For example, the President’s
direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by
his direction to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia
investigation to prospective election-interference only—a temporal connection that suggests that
both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation.

157

The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is
largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede
to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s
prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General
that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President’s
order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President’s message to Sessions that he
should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to
recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President’s direction to have the Special
Counsel removed, despite the President’s multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that
pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the
President’s aides and associates beyond those already filed.

b. In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President’s actions can
be divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President’s motives. In the
first phase, before the President fired Comey, the President had been assured that the FBI had not
opened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically important to make
public that he was not under investigation, and he included that information in his termination
letter to Comey after other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful.

Soon after he fired Comey, however, the President became aware that investigators were
conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked a
significant change in the President’s conduct and the start of a second phase of action. The
President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could
possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of
targeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance, the President attempted to remove the
Special Counsel; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the
investigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting
between Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses
who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the
government. Judgments about the nature of the President’s motives during each phase would be
informed by the totality of the evidence.

III. LEGAL DEFENSES TO THE APPLICATION OF OBSTRUCTION-OF-JUSTICE STATUTES TO
THE PRESIDENT

The President’s personal counsel has written to this Office to advance statutory and
constitutional defenses to the potential application of the obstruction-of-justice statutes to the
President’s conduct.'””? As a statutory matter, the President’s counsel has argued that a core
obstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2), does not cover the President’s actions.'®"
As a constitutional matter, the President’s counsel argued that the President cannot obstruct justice
by exercising his constitutional authority to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate
the FBI Director.'””* Under that view, any statute that restricts the President’s exercise of those
powers would impermissibly intrude on the President’s constitutional role. The President’s
counsel has conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve
exercises of his Article 1T authority, such as laws prohibiting bribing witnesses or suborning
perjury.'®” But counsel has made a categorical argument that “the President’s exercise of his
constitutional authority here to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations cannot
constitutionally constitute obstruction of justice.”'"’®

In analyzing counsel’s étatutory arguments, we concluded that the President’s proposed
interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2) is contrary to the litigating position of the Department of
Justice and is not supported by principles of statutory construction.

As for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the
courts have not definitively resolved these constitutional issues. We therefore analyzed the
President’s position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing the separation
of powers. Under that framework, we concluded, Article I of the Constitution does not
categorically and permanently immunize the President from potential liability for the conduct that
we investigated. Rather, our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can

validly prohibit a President’s corrupt efforts to use his official powers to curtail, end, or interfere
with an investigation.

A, Statutory Defenses to the Application of Obstruction-Of-Justice Provisions to
the Conduct Under Investigation

The obstruction-of-justice statute most readily applicable to our investigation is 18 U.S.C.
§ 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c) provides:

(c) Whoever corruptly—

(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or
attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for
use in an official proceeding; or

(2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts
to do so,

shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

The Department of Justice has taken the position that Section 1512(c)(2) states a broad,
independent, and unqualified prohibition on obstruction of justice.!””” While defendants have
argued that subsection (¢)(2) should be read to cover only acts that would impair the availability
or integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(1)’s focus, strong arguments weigh against
that proposed limitation. The text of Section 1512(c)(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to
Section 1512(c)(1); courts have so interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no
principle of statutory construction dictates a contrary view. On its face, therefore, Section
1512(c)(2) applies to all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or contemplated—
including by improper exercises of official power. In addition, other statutory provisions that are
potentially applicable to certain conduct we investigated broadly prohibit obstruction of
proceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503,
1505. Congress has also specifically prohibited witness tampering. See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b).

1. The Text of Section 1512(c)(2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive Acts

Several textual features of Section 1512(c)(2) support the conclusion that the provision
broadly prohibits corrupt means of obstructing justice and is not limited by the more specific
~ prohibitions in Section 1512(c)(1), which focus on evidence impairment.

First, the text of Section 1512(c)(2) is unqualified: it reaches acts that “obstruct[],
influence[], or impede[] any official proceeding” when committed “corruptly.” Nothing in Section
1512(c)(2)’s text limits the provision to acts that would impair the integrity or availability of
evidence for use in an official proceeding. Tn contrast, Section 1512(c)(1) explicitly includes the
requirement that the defendant act “with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability

June 5, 2006).

for use in an official proceeding,” a requirement that Congress also included in two other sections
of Section 1512. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with intent to cause a
person to destroy an object “with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use
in an official proceeding™); 1512(b)(2)(B) (use of intimidation, threats, corrupt persuasion, or
misleading conduct with intent to cause a person to destroy an object “with intent to impair the
integrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding”). But no comparable intent
or conduct element focused on evidence impairment appears in Section 1512(c)(2). The intent
element in Section 1512(c)(2) comes from the word “corruptly.” See, e.g., United States v.
McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) (“The intent element is important because the word
‘corruptly’ is what serves to separate criminal and innocent acts of obstruction.”) (internal
quotation marks omitted). And the conduct element in Section 1512(c)(2) is “obstruct[ing],
influenc[ing], or imped[ing]” a proceeding. Congress is presumed to have acted intentionally in
the disparate inclusion and exclusion of evidence-impairment language. See Loughrin v. United
States, 573 U.S. 351, 358 (2014) (“IW]hen ‘Congress includes particular language in one section
of a statute but omits it in another’—let alone in the very next provision—this Court ‘presume[s]’
that Congress intended a difference in meaning”) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16,
23 (1983)); accord Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. 767, 777 (2018).

Second, the structure of Section 1512 supports the conclusion that Section 1512(c)(2)
defines an independent offense. Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete crime with different
elements from Section 1512(c)(1)—and each subsection of Section 1512(c) contains its own
“attempt” prohibition, underscoring that they are independent prohibitions. The two subsections
of Section 1512(c) are connected by the conjunction “or,” indicating that each provides an
alternative basis for criminal liability. See Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357 (“ordinary use [of ‘or’] is
almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings”)
(internal quotation marks omitted). In Loughrin, for example, the Supreme Court relied on the use
of the word “or” to hold that adjacent and overlapping subsections of the bank fraud statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1344, state distinct offenses and that subsection 1344(2) therefore should not be
interpreted to contain an additional element specified only in subsection 1344(1). Id.; see also
Shaw v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 462, 465-469 (2016) (recognizing that the subsections of the
bank fraud statute “overlap substantially” but identifying distinct circumstances covered by
each).'”’”® And here, as in Loughrin, Section 1512(c)’s “two clauses have separate numbers, line
breaks before, between, and after them, and equivalent indentation—thus placing the clauses
visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings.” 573 U.S. at 359.

Third, the introductory word “otherwise™ in Section 1512(c)(2) signals that the provision
covers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512(c)(1). See Black’s Law
Dictionary 1101 (6th ed. 1990) (“otherwise” means “in a different manner; in another way, or in
other ways™); see also, e.g., American Heritage College Dictionary Online (“1. In another way;

 

107 The Office of Legal Counsel recently relied on several of the same interpretive principles in
concluding that language that appeared in the first clause of the Wire Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1084, restricting its
prohibition against certain betting or wagering activities to “any sporting event or contest,” did not apply
to the second clause of the same statute, which reaches other betting or wagering activities. See
Reconsidering Whether the Wire Act Applies to Non-Sports Gambling (Nov. 2, 2018), slip op. 7 (relying
on plain language); id. at 11 (finding it not “tenable to read into the second clause the qualifier ‘on any
sporting event or contest’ that appears in the first clause™); id. at 12 (relying on Digital Realty).

differently; 2. Under other circumstances™); see also Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128
(1936) (characterizing “otherwise” as a “broad term” and holding that a statutory prohibition on
kidnapping “for ransom or reward or otherwise” is not limited by the words “ransom” and
“reward” to kidnappings for pecuniary benefits); Collazos v. United States, 368 F.3d 190, 200 (2d
Cir. 2004) (construing “otherwise” in 28 U.S.C. § 2466(1)(C) to reach beyond the “specific
examples” listed in prior subsections, thereby covering the “myriad means that human ingenuity
might devise to permit a person to avoid the jurisdiction of a court”); cf. Begay v. United States,
553 U.S. 137, 144 (2006) (recognizing that “otherwise” is defined to mean “in a different way or
manner,” and holding that the word “otherwise” introducing the residual clause in the Armed
Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), can, but need not necessarily, “refer to a crime
that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others™).!"” The purpose of
the word “otherwise” in Section 1512(c)(2) is therefore to clarify that the provision covers
obstructive acts other than the destruction of physical evidence with the intent to impair its
integrity or availability, which is the conduct addressed in Section 1512(c)(1). The word
“otherwise” does not signal that Section 1512(c)(2) has less breadth in covering obstructive
conduct than the language of the provision implies.

2. Judicial Decisions Support a Broad Reading of Section 1512(¢)(2)

Courts have not limited Section 1512(c)(2) to conduct that impairs evidence, but instead
have read it to cover obstructive acts in any form.

As one court explained, “[t]his expansive subsection operates as a catch-all to cover
‘otherwise’ obstructive behavior that might not constitute a more specific offense like document
destruction, which is listed in (c)(1).” United States v. Volpendesto, 746 F.3d 273, 286 (7th Cir.
2014) (some quotation marks omitted). For example, in United States v. Ring, 628 F. Supp. 2d
195 (D.D.C. 2009), the court rejected the argument that “§ 1512(c)(2)’s reference to conduct that
‘otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding’ is limited to conduct that is
similar to the type of conduct proscribed by subsection (¢)(1)—namely, conduct that impairs the
integrity or availability of ‘record[s], documents[s], or other object[s] for use in an official
proceeding.” Id. at 224. The court explained that “the meaning of § 1512(c)(2) is plain on its
face.” Id. (alternations in original). And courts have upheld convictions under Section 1512(c)(2)
that did not involve evidence impairment, but instead resulted from conduct that more broadly
thwarted arrests or investigations. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, 862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir.
2017) (police officer tipped off suspects about issuance of arrest warrants before “outstanding
warrants could be executed, thereby potentially interfering with an ongoing grand jury
proceeding™); United States v. Ahrensfield, 698 F.3d 1310, 1324-1326 (10th Cir. 2012) (officer
disclosed existence of an undercover investigation to its target); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d
1261, 1265 (10th Cir. 2009) (defendant disclosed identity of an undercover officer thus preventing
him from making controlled purchases from methamphetamine dealers). Those cases illustrate
that Section 1512(c)(2) applies to corrupt acts—including by public officials—that frustrate the

 

1979 1n Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 15 (2011), the Supreme Court substantially abandoned
Begay’s reading of the residual clause, and in Johnson v. United States, 135 8. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Court
invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. Begay’s analysis of the word “otherwise” is
thus of limited value.

162

U.S. Department of Justice

commencement or conduct of a proceeding, and not just to acts that make evidence unavailable or
impair its integrity.

Section 1512(c)(2)’s breadth is reinforced by the similarity of its language to the omnibus
clause of 18 U.S.C. § 1503, which covers anyone who “corruptly . . . obstructs, or impedes, or
endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.” That clause of
Section 1503 follows two more specific clauses that protect jurors, judges, and court officers. The
omnibus clause has nevertheless been construed to be “far more general in scope than the earlier
clauses of the statute.” United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995). “The omnibus clause
is essentially a catch-all provision which generally prohibits conduct that interferes with the due
administration of justice.” Unifed States v. Brenson, 104 ¥.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 1997). Courts
have accordingly given it a “non-restrictive reading.” United States v. Kumar, 617 F.3d 612, 620
(2d Cir. 2010); id. at 620 n.7 (collecting cases from the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh
Circuits). As one court has explained, the omnibus clause “prohibits acts that are similar in result,
rather than manner, to the conduct described in the first part of the statute.” United States v.
Howard, 569 F.2d 1331, 1333 (5th Cir. 1978). While the specific clauses “forbid certain means
of obstructing justice . . . the omnibus clause aims at obstruction of justice itself, regardless of the
means used to reach that result.” Id. (collecting cases). Given the similarity of Section 1512(c)(2)
to Section 1503’s omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts
that produced a similar result to the evidence-impairment provisions—i.e., the result of obstructing
justice—rather than covering only acts that were similar in manner. Read this way, Section
1512(c)(2) serves a distinct function in the federal obstruction-of-justice statutes: it captures
corrupt conduct, other than document destruction, that has the natural tendency to obstruct
contemplated as well as pending proceedings.

Section 1512(c)(2) overlaps with other obstruction statutes, but it does not render them
superfluous.  Section 1503, for example, which covers pending grand jury and judicial
proceedings, and Section 1505, which covers pending administrative and congressional
proceedings, reach “endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede” the proceedings—a broader test
for inchoate violations than Section 1512(c)(2)’s “attempt” standard, which requires a substantial
step towards a completed offense. See United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018)
(“[E]fforts to witness tamper that rise to the level of an ‘endeavor’ yet fall short of an ‘attempt’
cannot be prosecuted under § 1512.”); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th
Cir. 1988) (collecting cases recognizing the difference between the “endeavor” and “attempt”
standards). And 18 U.S.C. § 1519, which prohibits destruction of documents or records in
contemplation of an investigation or proceeding, does not require the “nexus” showing under
Aguilar, which Section 1512(c)(2) demands. See, e.g., United States v. Yielding, 657 F.3d 688,
712 (8th Cir. 2011) (“The requisite knowledge and intent [under Section 1519] can be present even
if the accused lacks knowledge that he is likely to succeed in obstructing the matter.”); Unifed
States v. Gray, 642 F.3d 371, 376-377 (2d Cir. 2011) (“[I]n enacting § 1519, Congress rejected
any requirement that the government prove a link between a defendant’s conduct and an imminent
or pending official proceeding.”). The existence of even “substantial” overlap is not “uncommon”
in criminal statutes. Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 359 n.4; see Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 458-469; Aguilar, 515
U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“The fact that there is now some overlap between § 1503 and
§ 1512 is no more intolerable than the fact that there is some overlap between the omnibus clause
of § 1503 and the other provisions of § 1503 itself.”). But given that Sections 1503, 1505, and

163

1519 each reach conduct that Section 1512(c)(2) does not, the overlap provides no reason to give
Section 1512(c)(2) an artificially limited construction. See Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 469.'%%

3. The Legislative History of Section 1512(c)(2) Does Not Justify Narrowing [ts
Text

“Given the straightforward statutory command” in Section 1512(c)(2), “there is no reason
to resort to legislative history.” United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 6 (1997). In any event, the
legislative history of Section 1512(c)(2) is not a reason to impose extratextual limitations on its
reach.

Congress enacted Section 1512(c)(2) as part the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No.
107-204, Tit. XI, § 1102, 116 Stat. 807. The relevant section of the statute was entitled
“Tampering with a Record or Otherwise Impeding an Official Proceeding.” 116 Stat. 807
(emphasis added). That title indicates that Congress intended the two clauses to have independent
effect. Section 1512(c) was added as a floor amendment in the Senate and explained as closing a
certain “loophole” with respect to “document shredding.” See 148 Cong. Rec. 86545 (July 10,
2002) (Sen. Lott); id. at $6549-S6550 (Sen. Hatch). But those explanations do not limit the enacted
text. See Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U.S. 105, 115 (1988) (“[1]t is not the law that a
statute can have no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history.”); see also
Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 138 S. Ct. 1134, 1143 (2018) (“Even if Congress did not
foresee all of the applications of the statute, that is no reason not to give the statutory text a fair
reading.”). The floor statements thus cannot detract from the meaning of the enacted text. See
Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 457 (2002) (“Floor statements from two Senators
cannot amend the clear and unambiguous language of a statute. We see no reason to give greater
weight to the views of two Senators than to the collective votes of both Houses, which are
memorialized in the unambiguous statutory text.”). That principle has particular force where one
of the proponents of the amendment to Section 1512 introduced his remarks as only “briefly
elaborat[ing] on some of the specific provisions contained in this bill.” 148 Cong. Rec. S6550
(Sen. Hatch).

Indeed, the language Congress used in Section 1512(c)(2)—prohibiting “corruptly . . .
obstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing] any official proceeding” or attempting to do so—
parallels a provision that Congress considered years earlier in a bill designed to strengthen
protections against witness tampering and obstruction of justice. While the earlier provision is not
a direct antecedent of Section 1512(c)(2), Congress’s understanding of the broad scope of the

 

1980 The Supreme Court’s decision in Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101 (2018), does not
suppott imposing a non-textual limitation on Section 1512(c)(2). Marinello interpreted the tax obstruction
statute, 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), to require “a ‘nexus’ between the defendant’s conduct and a patticular
administrative proceeding.” Id. at 1109. The Court adopted that construction in light of the similar
interpretation given to “other obstruction provisions,” id. (citing Aguilar and Arthur Andersen), as well as
considerations of context, legislative history, structure of the criminal tax laws, fair warning, and lenity. /d.
at 1106-1108. The type of “nexus” element the Court adopted in Marinello already applies under Section
1512(c)(2), and the remaining considerations the Court cited do not justify reading into Section 1512(c)(2)
language that is not there. See Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29 (1997) (the Court “ordinarily resist[s]
reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.”).

carlier provision is instructive. Recognizing that “the proper administration of justice may be
impeded or thwarted” by a “variety of corrupt methods . . . limited only by the imagination of the
criminally inclined,” S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (1982), Congress considered a
bill that would have amended Section 1512 by making it a crime, infer alia, when a person
“corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes . . . [t]he enforcement and prosecution of federal
law,” “administration of a law under which an official proceeding is being or may be conducted,”
or the “exercise of a Federal legislative power of inquiry.” Id. at 17-19 (quoting S. 2420).

The Senate Committee explained that:

[T]he purpose of preventing an obstruction of or miscarriage of justice cannot be fully
carried out by a simple enumeration of the commonly prosecuted obstruction offenses.
There must also be protection against the rare type of conduct that is the product of the
inventive criminal mind and which also thwarts justice.

Id. at 18. The report gave examples of conduct “actually prosecuted under the current residual
clause [in 18 U.S.C. § 1503], which would probably not be covered in this series [of provisions]
without a residual clause.” Id One prominent example was “[a] conspiracy to cover up the
Watergate burglary and its aftermath by having the Central Intelligence Agency seek to interfere
with an ongoing FBI investigation of the burglary.” Id. (citing United States v. Haldeman, 559
F.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976)). The report therefore indicates a congressional awareness not only that
residual-clause language resembling Section 1512(c)(2) broadly covers a wide variety of
obstructive conduct, but also that such language reaches the improper use of governmental
processes to obstruct justice—specifically, the Watergate cover-up orchestrated by White House
officials including the President himself. See Haldeman, 559 F.3d at 51, 86-87, 120-129, 162.'%!

4. General Principles of Statutory Construction Do Not Suggest That Section
1512(c)(2) is [napplicable to the Conduct in this Investigation

The requirement of fair warning in criminal law, the interest in avoiding due process
concerns in potentially vague statutes, and the rule of lenity do not justify narrowing the reach of
Section 1512(c)(2)’s text.'%2

a. As with other criminal laws, the Supreme Court has “exercised restraint” in interpreting
obstruction-of-justice provisions, both out of respect for Congress’s role in defining crimes and in
the interest of providing individuals with “fair warning” of what a criminal statute prohibits.
Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018); Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 703;

 

108! The Senate ultimately accepted the House version of the bill, which excluded an omnibus
clause. See United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369, 382-383 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (tracing history of the
proposed omnibus provision in the witness-protection legislation). During the floor debate on the bill,
Senator Heinz, one of the initiators and primary backers of the legislation, explained that the omnibus clause
was beyond the scope of the witness-protection measure at issue and likely “duplicative” of other
obstruction laws, 128 Cong. Rec. 26,810 (1982) (Sen. Heinz), presumably referring to Sections 1503 and
1505.

1982 T a separate section addressing considerations unique to the presidency, we consider principles
of statutory construction relevant in that context. See Volume II, Section II.B.1, infra.

Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 599-602. In several obstruction cases, the Court has imposed a nexus test that
requires that the wrongful conduct targeted by the provision be sufficiently connected to an official
proceeding to ensure the requisite culpability. Marinello, 138 S. Ct. at 1109; Arthur Andersen,
544 U.S. at 707-708; Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600-602. Section 1512(c)(2) has been interpreted to
require a similar nexus. See, e.g., United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019);
United States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d
1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). To satisfy
the nexus requirement, the government must show as an objective matter that a defendant acted
“in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,” such that the statute “excludes defendants who have
an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful.”
Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at 599 (“the endeavor
must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice”)
(internal quotation marks omitted). The government must also show as a subjective matter that
the actor “contemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.” Pefruk, 781 F.3d at 445. Those
requirements alleviate fair-warning concerns by ensuring that obstructive conduct has a close
enough connection to existing or future proceedings to implicate the dangers targeted by the
obstruction laws and that the individual actually has the obstructive result in mind.

b. Courts also seek to construe statutes to avoid due process vagueness concerns. See, e.g.,
MecDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2016); Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358,
368, 402-404 (2010). Vagueness doctrine requires that a statute define a crime “with sufficient
definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited” and “in a manner that
does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Jd. at 402-403 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The obstruction statutes’ requirement of acting “corruptly” satisfies that test.

“Acting ‘corruptly’ within the meaning of § 1512(c)(2) means acting with an improper
purpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert,
impede or obstruct” the relevant proceeding. United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 (10th
Cir. 2013) (some quotation marks omitted). The majority opinion in Aguilar did not address the
defendant’s vagueness challenge to the word “corruptly,” 515 U.S. at 600 n. 1, but Justice Scalia’s
separate opinion did reach that issue and would have rejected the challenge, id. at 616-617 (Scalia,
J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). “Statutory
language need not be colloquial,” Justice Scalia explained, and “the term ‘corruptly’ in criminal
laws has a longstanding and well-accepted meaning. It denotes an act done with an intent to give
some advantage inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.” Id. at 616 (internal
quotation marks omitted; citing lower court authority and legal dictionaries). Justice Scalia added
that “in the context of obstructing jury proceedings, any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is
incredible.” Id. at 617. Lower courts have also rejected vagueness challenges to the word
“corruptly.” See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 869 F.3d 490, 501-502 (7th Cir. 2017); United
States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1280-1281 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d
1331, 1336 n.9 (5th Cir. 1978). This well-established intent standard precludes the need to limit
the obstruction statutes to only certain kinds of inherently wrongful conduct.!%

 

1983 1y United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the court of appeals found the
term “corruptly” in 18 U.S.C. § 1505 vague as applied to a person who provided false information to
Congress. After suggesting that the word “corruptly” was vague on its face, 951 F.2d at 378, the court

c. Finally, the rule of lenity does not justify treating Section 1512(c)(2) as a prohibition on
evidence impairment, as opposed to an omnibus clause. The rule of lenity is an interpretive
principle that resolves ambiguity in criminal laws in favor of the less-severe construction.
Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000). “[A]s [the Court has] repeatedly emphasized,”
however, the rule of lenity applies only if, “after considering text, structure, history and purpose,
there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply
guess as to what Congress intended.” Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 188 n.10 (2014)
(internal quotation marks omitted). The rule has been cited, for example, in adopting a narrow
meaning of “tangible object” in an obstruction statute when the prohibition’s title, history, and list
of prohibited acts indicated a focus on destruction of records. See Yates v. United States, 135 S.
Ct. 1074, 1088 (2015) (plurality opinion) (interpreting “tangible object” in the phrase “record,
document, or tangible object” in 18 U.S.C. § 1519 to mean an item capable of recording or
preserving information). Here, as discussed above, the text, structure, and history of Section
1512(c)(2) leaves no “grievous ambiguity” about the statute’s meaning. Section 1512(c)(2)
defines a structurally independent general prohibition on obstruction of official proceedings.

5. Other Obstruction Statutes Might Apply to the Conduct in this Investigation

Regardless whether Section 1512(c)(2) covers all corrupt acts that obstruct, influence, or
impede pending or contemplated proceedings, other statutes would apply to such conduct in
pending proceedings, provided that the remaining statutory elements are satisfied. As discussed
above, the omnibus clause in 18 U.S.C. § 1503(a) applies generally to obstruction of pending
judicial and grand proceedings.'®® See Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 598 (noting that the clause is “far
more general in scope” than preceding provisions). Section 1503(a)’s protections extend to
witness tampering and to other obstructive conduct that has a nexus to pending proceedings. See
Sampson, 898 F.3d at 298-303 & n.6 (collecting cases from eight circuits holding that Section
1503 covers witness-related obstructive conduct, and cabining prior circuit authority). And
Section 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conduct aimed at pending agency and congressional
proceedings.'% See, e.g., United States v. Rainey, 757 F.3d 234, 241-247 (5th Cir. 2014).

 

concluded that the statute did not clearly apply to corrupt conduct by the person himself and the “core”
conduct to which Section 1505 could constitutionally be applied was one person influencing another person
to violate a legal duty. Id. at 379-386. Congress later enacted a provision overturning that result by
providing that “[a]s used in [S]ection 1505, the term ‘corruptly’ means acting with an improper purpose,
personally or by influencing another, including by making a false or misleading statement, or withholding,
concealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information.” 18 U.S.C. § 1515(b). Other courts
have declined to follow Poindexter either by limiting it to Section 1505 and the specific conduct at issue in
that case, see Brenson, 104 F.3d at 1280-1281; reading it as narrowly limited to certain types of conduct,
see United States v. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 629-630 (D.C. Cir. 1996); or by noting that it predated Arthur
Andersen’s interpretation of the term “corruptly,” see Edwards, 869 F.3d at 501-502.

1984 Section 1503(a) provides for criminal punishment of:

Whoever . . . corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or
communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or
impede, the due administration of justice.

1985 Section 1505 provides for criminal punishment of:

167

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney-WerkProduet // May-Contain-Material Proteeted-HnderFed—R—CrinP-6te)

Finally, 18 U.S.C. § [512(b)(3) criminalizes tampering with witnesses to prevent the
communication of information about a crime to law enforcement. The nexus inquiry articulated
in Aguilar—that an individual has “knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial
proceeding,” 515 U.S. at 599—does not apply to Section 1512(b)(3). See United States v. Byrne,
435 F.3d 16, 24-25 (1st Cir, 2006). The nexus inquiry turns instead on the actor’s intent to prevent
communications to a federal law enforcement official. See Fowler v. United States, 563 U.S. 668,
673-678 (2011).

In sum, in light of the breadth of Section 1512(c)(2) and the other obstruction statutes, an
argument that the conduct at issue in this investigation falls outside the scope of the obstruction -
laws lacks merit.

B. Constitutional Defenses to Applying Obstruction-Of-Justice Statutes to
Presidential Conduct

The President has broad discretion to direct criminal investigations. The Constitution vests
the “executive Power” in the President and enjoins him to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed.” U.S. ConsT. ART II, §§ 1, 3. Those powers and duties form the foundation of
prosecutorial discretion. See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (Attorney
General and United States Attorneys “have this latitude because they are designated by statute as
the President’s delegates to help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that
the Laws be faithfully executed.””). The President also has authority to appoint officers of the
United States and to remove those whom he has appointed. U.S. CONST. ARTIL, § 2, cl. 2 (granting
authority to the President to appoint all officers with the advice and consent of the Senate, but
providing that Congress may vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President alone, the
heads of departments, or the courts of law); see also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 492-493, 509 (2010) (describing removal authority as
flowing from the President’s “responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed”).

Although the President has broad authority under Article II, that authority coexists with
Congress’s Article I power to enact laws that protect congressional proceedings, federal
investigations, the courts, and grand juries against corrupt efforts to undermine their functions.
Usually, those constitutional powers function in harmony, with the President enforcing the
criminal laws under Article I to protect against corrupt obstructive acts. But when the President’s
official actions come into conflict with the prohibitions in the obstruction statutes, any
constitutional tension is reconciled through separation-of-powers analysis.

 

Whoever corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence,
obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending
proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due
and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is
being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the
Congress.

The President’s counsel has argued that “the President’s exercise of his constitutional
authority . . . to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations . . . cannot constitutionally
constitute obstruction of justice.”'®®® As noted above, no Department of Justice position or
Supreme Court precedent directly resolved this issue. We did not find counsel’s contention,
however, to accord with our reading of the Supreme Court authority addressing separation-of-
powers issues. Applying the Court’s framework for analysis, we concluded that Congress can
validly regulate the President’s exercise of official duties to prohibit actions motivated by a corrupt
intent to obstruct justice. The limited effect on presidential power that results from that restriction
would not impermissibly undermine the President’s ability to perform his Article II functions.

1. The Reguirement of a Clear Statement to Apply Statutes to Presidential
Conduct Does Not Limit the Obstruction Statutes

Before addressing Article 11 issues directly, we consider one threshold statutory-
construction principle that is unique to the presidency: “The principle that general statutes must
be read as not applying to the President if they do not expressly apply where application would
arguably limit the President’s constitutional role.” OLC, Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to
Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. 350, 352 (1995). This “clear
statement rule,” id., has its source in two principles: statutes should be construed to avoid serious
constitutional questions, and Congress should not be assumed to have altered the constitutional
separation of powers without clear assurance that it intended that result. OLC, The Constitutional
Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. O.L.C. 124, 178 (1996).

The Supreme Court has applied that clear-statement rule in several cases. In one leading
case, the Court construed the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 ef seq., not to apply
to judicial review of presidential action. Franklinv. Massachuselts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-801 (1992).
The Court explained that it “would require an express statement by Congress before assuming it
intended the President’s performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.”
Id. at 801. In another case, the Court interpreted the word “utilized” in the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App., to apply only to the use of advisory committees
established directly or indirectly by the government, thereby excluding the American Bar
Association’s advice to the Department of Justice about federal judicial candidates. Public Citizen
v. United States Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 455, 462-467 (1989). The Court explained
that a broader interpretation of the term “utilized” in FACA would raise serious questions whether
the statute “infringed unduly on the President’s Article IT power to nominate federal judges and
violated the doctrine of separation of powers.” Id. at 466-467. Another case found that an
established canon of statutory construction applied with “special force™ to provisions that would
impinge on the President’s foreign-affairs powers if construed broadly. Sale v. Haitian Centers
Council, 509 U.S. 155, 188 (1993) (applying the presumption against extraterritorial application
to construe the Refugee Act of 1980 as not governing in an overseas context where it could affect
“foreign and military affairs for which the President has unique responsibility”). See Application

 

1086 6/23/17 Letter, President’s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel’s Office, at 2 n. 1.

U.S. Department of Justice
Attornrey-WerleProduet / May-CentainMatertal-Proteeted-Under Fed- R—Crim—P—6(e)

of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 353-354
(discussing Franklin, Public Citizen, and Sale).

The Department of Justice has relied on this clear-statement principle to interpret certain
statutes as not applying to the President at all, similar to the approach taken in Franklin. See, e.g.,
Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman,
Deputy Attorney General, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising out of the President’s
Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-Fifih Amendment to
the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (criminal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 208,
does not apply to the President). Other OLC opinions interpret statutory text not to apply to certain
presidential or executive actions because of constitutional concerns. See Application of 28 U.S.C.
§ 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 350-357 (consanguinity
limitations on court appointments, 28 U.S.C. § 458, found inapplicable to “presidential
appointments of judges to the federal judiciary”); Constraints Imposed by 18 U.S.C. § 1913 on
Lobbying Efforts, 13 Op. O.L.C. 300, 304-306 (1989) (limitation on the use of appropriated funds
for certain lobbying programs found inapplicable to certain communications by the President and
executive officials).

But OLC has also recognized that this clear-statement rule “does not apply with respect to
a statute that raises no separation of powers questions were it to be applied to the President,” such
as the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201. Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential
Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. OLC explained that “[a]pplication
of § 201 raises no separation of powers question, let alone a serious one,” because [t]he
Constitution confers no power in the President to receive bribes.” Id. In support of that conclusion,
OLC noted constitutional provisions that forbid increases in the President’s compensation while
in office, “which is what a bribe would function to do,” id. (citing U.S. CONST. ART.1I, § 1, cl. 7),
and the express constitutional power of “Congress to impeach [and convict] a President for, infer
alia, bribery,” id. (citing U.S. CONST. ARTIL, § 4).

Under OLC’s analysis, Congress can permissibly criminalize certain obstructive conduct
by the President, such as suborning perjury, intimidating witnesses, or fabricating evidence,
because those prohibitions raise no separation-of-powers questions. See Application of 28 U.S.C.
§ 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. The
Constitution does not authorize the President to engage in such conduct, and those actions would
transgress the President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. CONST.
ART I, §§ 3. In view of those clearly permissible applications of the obstruction statutes to the
President, Franklin’s holding that the President is entirely excluded from a statute absent a clear
statement would not apply in this context.

A more limited application of a clear-statement rule to exclude from the obstruction statutes
only certain acts by the President—for example, removing prosecutors or ending investigations
for corrupt reasons—would be difficult to implement as a matter of statutory interpretation. It is
not obvious how a clear-statement rule would apply to an omnibus provision like Section
1512(c)(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only when carried out in the President’s
conduct of office. No statutory term could easily bear that specialized meaning. For example, the
word “corruptly” has a well-established meaning that does not exclude exercises of official power
for corrupt ends. Indeed, an established definition states that “corruptly” means action with an

170

intent to secure an improper advantage “inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.”
BALLENTINE’S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969) (emphasis added). And it would be contrary
to ordinary rules of statutory construction to adopt an unconventional meaning of a statutory term
only when applied to the President. See United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008)
(plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (rejecting proposal to “giv|[e] the same word, in the same statutory
provision, different meanings in different factual contexts™); ¢f. Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 462-
467 (giving the term “utilized” in the FACA a uniform meaning to avoid constitutional questions).
Nor could such an exclusion draw on a separate and established background interpretive
presumption, such as the presumption against extraterritoriality applied in Sale. The principle that
courts will construe a statute to avoid serious constitutional questions “is not a license for the
judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.” Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52,
59-60 (1997). “It is one thing to acknowledge and accept . . . well defined (or even newly
enunciated), generally applicable, background principles of assumed legislative intent. It is quite
another to espouse the broad proposition that criminal statutes do not have to be read as broadly
as they are written, but are subject to case-by-case exceptions.” Brogan v. United States, 522 U.S.
398, 406 (1998).

When a proposed construction “would thus function as an extra-textual limit on [a statute’s]
compass,” thereby preventing the statute “from applying to a host of cases falling within its clear
terms,” Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357, it is doubtful that the construction would reflect Congress’s
intent. That is particularly so with respect to obstruction statutes, which “have been given a broad
and all-inclusive meaning.” Rainey, 757 F.3d at 245 (discussing Sections 1503 and 1505) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, since no established principle of interpretation would
exclude the presidential conduct we have investigated from statutes such as Sections 1503, 1505,
1512(b), and 1512(c)(2), we proceed to examine the separation-of-powers issues that could be
raised as an Article Il defense to the application of those statutes.

2. Separation-of-Powers Principles Support the Conclusion that Congress May
Validly Prohibit Corrupt Obstructive Acts Carried Out Through the President’s
Official Powers

When Congress imposes a limitation on the exercise of Article II powers, the limitation’s
validity depends on whether the measure “disrupts the balance between the coordinate branches.”
Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425, 443 (1977). “Even when a branch does
not arrogate power to itself, . . . the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not impair
another in the performance of its constitutional duties.” Loving v. Uniied States, 517 U.S. 748,
757 (1996). The “separation of powers does not mean,” however, “that the branches ‘ought to
have no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of each other.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S.
681, 703 (1997) (quoting James Madison, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325-326 (J. Cooke ed. 1961)
(emphasis omitted)). In this context, a balancing test applies to assess separation-of-powers issues.
Applying that test here, we concluded that Congress can validly make obstruction-of-justice
statutes applicable to corruptly motivated official acts of the President without impermissibly
undermining his Article I functions.

a. The Supreme Court’s Separation-of-Powers Balancing Test Applies
In This Context

A congressionally imposed limitation on presidential action is assessed to determine “the
extent to which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned
functions,” and, if the “potential for disruption is present[,] . . . whether that impact is justified by
an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.”
Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731,753-
754 (1982); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706-707 (1974). That balancing test applies to
a congressional regulation of presidential power through the obstruction-of-justice laws. '°*’

When an Article II power has not been “explicitly assigned by the text of the Constitution
to be within the sole province of the President, but rather was thought to be encompassed within
the general grant to the President of the ‘executive Power,”” the Court has balanced competing
constitutional considerations. Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 484 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the
judgment, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and O’Connor, I.). As Justice Kennedy noted in Public
Citizen, the Court has applied a balancing test to restrictions on “the President’s power to remove
Executive officers, a power [that] . . . is not conferred by any explicit provision in the text of the
Constitution (as is the appointment power), but rather is inferred to be a necessary part of the grant
of the ‘executive Power.”” Id. (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (1988), and Myers v.
United States, 272 U.S. 52, 115-116 (1926)). Consistent with that statement, Morrison sustained
a good-cause limitation on the removal of an inferior officer with defined prosecutorial
responsibilitics after determining that the limitation did not impermissibly undermine the
President’s ability to perform his Article II functions. 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696. The Court
has also evaluated other general executive-power claims through a balancing test. For example,
the Court evaluated the President’s claim of an absolute privilege for presidential communications
about his official acts by balancing that interest against the Judicial Branch’s need for evidence in
a criminal case. United States v. Nixon, supra (recognizing a qualified constitutional privilege for
presidential communications on official matters). The Court has also upheld a law that provided
for archival access to presidential records despite a claim of absolute presidential privilege over
the records. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443-445, 451-455. The analysis in
those cases supports applying a balancing test to assess the constitutionality of applying the
obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential exercises of executive power.

Only in a few instances has the Court applied a different framework. When the President’s
power is “both ‘exclusive’ and ‘conclusive’ on the issue,” Congress is precluded from regulating
its exercise. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2084 (2015). In Zivotofsky, for example, the
Court followed “Justice Jackson’s familiar tripartite framework” in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring), and held that the President’s

 

1987 OLC applied such a balancing test in concluding that the President is not subject to criminal
prosecution while in office, relying on many of the same precedents discussed in this section. See 4 Sitting
President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222, 237-238, 244-245
(2000) (relying on, inter alia, United States v. Nixon, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and Clinton v. Jones, and quoting
the legal standard from Administrator of General Services v. Nixon that is applied in the text). OLC
recognized that “[t]he balancing analysis™ it had initially relied on in finding that a sitting President is
immune from prosecution had “been adopted as the appropriate mode of analysis by the Court.” Id. at 244.

authority to recognize foreign nations is exclusive. Id. at 2083, 2094. See also Public Citizen 491
U.S. at 485-486 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (citing the power to grant pardons under
U.S. CONST., ART. I, § 2, cl. 1, and the Presentment Clauses for legislation, U.S. CONST., ART. I,
§ 7, Cls. 2, 3, as examples of exclusive presidential powers by virtue of constitutional text).

But even when a power is exclusive, “Congress’ powers, and its central role in making
laws, give it substantial authority regarding many of the policy determinations that precede and
follow” the President’s act. Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2087. For example, although the President’s
power to grant pardons is exclusive and not subject to congressional regulation, see United States
v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 147-148 (1872), Congress has the authority to prohibit the corrupt
use of “anything of value” to influence the testimony of another person in a judicial, congressional,
or agency proceeding, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(3)—which would include the offer or promise of a
pardon to induce a person to testify falsely or not to testify at all. The offer of a pardon would
precede the act of pardoning and thus be within Congress’s power to regulate even if the pardon
itself is not. Just as the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. CONST. ART. 1, § 6, cl.1, absolutely protects
legislative acts, but not a legislator’s “taking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in a
certain way . . . for it is taking the bribe, not performance of the illicit compact, that is a criminal
act,” United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 526 (1972) (emphasis omitted), the promise of a
pardon to corruptly influence testimony would not be a constitutionally immunized act. The
application of obstruction statutes to such promises therefore would raise no serious separation-
of-powers issue.

b. The Effect of Obstruction-of-Justice Statutes on the President’s
Capacity to Perform His Article 11 Responsibilities is Limited

Under the Supreme Court’s balancing test for analyzing separation-of-powers issues, the
first task is to assess the degree to which applying obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential
actions affects the President’s ability to carry out his Article II responsibilities. Administrator of
General Services, 433 U.S. at 443. As discussed above, applying obstruction-of-justice statutes
to presidential conduct that does not involve the President’s conduct of office—such as influencing
the testimony of witnesses—is constitutionally unproblematic. The President has no more right
than other citizens to impede official proceedings by corruptly influencing witness testimony. The
conduct would be equally improper whether effectuated through direct efforts to produce false
testimony or suppress the truth, or through the actual, threatened, or promised use of official
powers to achieve the same result.

The President’s action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions, or discharging
law enforcement officials, raises different questions. Each type of action involves the exercise of
executive discretion in furtherance of the President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed.” U.S. CONsT., ART. II, § 3. Congress may not supplant the President’s exercise of
executive power to supervise prosecutions or to remove officers who occupy law enforcement
positions. See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726-727 (1986) (“Congress cannot reserve for
itself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by
impeachment. . . . [Because t]he structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute
the laws, . . [ Jhis kind of congressional control over the execution of the laws . . . is
constitutionally impermissible.”). Yet the obstruction-of-justice statutes do not aggrandize power
in Congress or usurp executive authority. Instead, they impose a discrete limitation on conduct

173


==================== PAGE 387 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice
Attorney—WetcProduet // May-Centain-Material-Proteeted-Underted—R-Crim—P-6(e)

only when it is taken with the “corrupt” intent to obstruct justice. The obstruction statutes thus
would restrict presidential action only by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official
proceedings for the improper purpose of protecting his own interests. See Volume II, Section
I1.A.3, supra.

The direct effect on the President’s freedom of action would correspondingly be a limited
one. A preclusion of “corrupt™ official action is not a major intrusion on Article II powers. For
example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act
with the intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability, or
preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action
undertaken for such personal purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded
administration of the law. And the Constitution does not mandate that the President have
unfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever, in order to
carry out his Article II functions. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 833 (1985) (“Congress
may limit an agency’s exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive
priorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency’s power to discriminate among issues or cases
it will pursue.”); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707 (“[t]o read the Art. II powers of the
President as providing an absolute privilege [to withhold confidential communications from a
criminal trial]. . . would upset the constitutional balance of ‘a workable government’ and gravely
impair the role of the courts under Art. IIT”).

Nor must the President have unfettered authority to remove all Executive Branch officials
involved in the execution of the laws. The Constitution establishes that Congress has legislative
authority to structure the Executive Branch by authorizing Congress to create executive
departments and officer positions and to specify how inferior officers are appointed. E.g., U.S.
CONST., ART. 1, § 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); ART. I, § 2, cl. 1 (Opinions Clause);
ART. I, § 2, cl. 2 (Appointments Clause); see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 499. While the
President’s removal power is an important means of ensuring that officers faithfully execute the
law, Congress has a recognized authority to place certain limits on removal. Id. at 493-495.

The President’s removal powers are at their zenith with respect to principal officers—that
is, officers who must be appointed by the President and who report to him directly. See Free
Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493, 500. The President’s “exclusive and illimitable power of
removal” of those principal officers furthers “the President’s ability to ensure that the laws are
faithfully executed.” Id. at 493, 498 (internal quotation marks omitted); Myers, 272 U.S. at 627.
Thus, “there are some ‘purely executive’ officials who must be removable by the President at will
if he is able to accomplish his constitutional role.” Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690; Myers, 272 U.S. at
134 (the President’s “cabinet officers must do his will,” and “[t]he moment that he loses confidence
in the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of any one of them, he must have the power to
remove him without delay”); ¢f. Humphrey'’s Executor v. Uniled States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935)
(Congress has the power to create independent agencies headed by principal officers removable
only for good cause). In light of those constitutional precedents, it may be that the obstruction
statutes could not be constitutionally applied to limit the removal of a cabinet officer such as the
Attorney General. See 5 U.S.C. § 101; 28 U.S.C. § 503. In that context, at least absent
circumstances showing that the President was clearly attempting to thwart accountability for
personal conduct while evading ordinary political checks and balances, even the highly limited

regulation imposed by the obstruction statutes could possibly intrude too deeply on the President’s
freedom to select and supervise the members of his cabinet.

The removal of inferior officers, in contrast, need not necessarily be at will for the President
to fulfill his constitutionally assigned role in managing the Executive Branch. “[I]nferior officers
are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by other officers appointed by
the President with the Senate’s consent.” Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 510 (quoting Edmond
v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme
Court has long recognized Congress’s authority to place for-cause limitations on the President’s
removal of “inferior Officers” whose appointment may be vested in the head of a department. U.S.
CONST. ART. II, § 2, cl. 2. See United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886) (“The
constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment [of inferior officers in the heads
of departments] implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as
Congress may enact in relation to the officers so appointed™) (quoting lower court decision);
Morrison, 487 U.S. at 689 n. 27 (citing Perkins); accord id. at 723-724 & n.4 (Scalia, J., dissenting)
(recognizing that Perkins is “established” law); see also Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493-
495 (citing Perkins and Morrison). The category of inferior officers includes both the FBI Director
and the Special Counsel, each of whom reports to the Attorney General. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 509,
515(a), 531; 28 C.F.R. Part 600. Their work is thus “directed and supervised” by a presidentially-
appointed, Senate-confirmed officer. See In re: Grand Jury Investigation,  F.3d __, 2019 WL
021692, at *3-*4 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 26, 2019) (holding that the Special Counsel is an “inferior officer”
for constitutional purposes). '

Where the Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-cause limitation on the removal
of an Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally permit Congress to bar removal
for the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. Limiting the.range of permissible reasons for
removal to exclude a “corrupt” purpose imposes a lesser restraint on the President than requiring
an affirmative showing of good cause. It follows that for such inferior officers, Congress may
constitutionally restrict the President’s removal authority if that authority was exercised for the
corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. And even if a particular inferior officer’s position might be
of such importance to the execution of the laws that the President must have at-will removal
authority, the obstruction-of-justice statutes could still be constitutionally applied to forbid
removal for a corrupt reason.'™® A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded
corrupt action would leave ample room for all other considerations, including disagreement over
policy or loss of confidence in the officer’s judgment or commitment. A corrupt-purpose
prohibition therefore would not undermine the President’s ability to perform his Article II
functions. Accordingly, because the separation-of-powers question is “whether the removal
restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s ability to perform his
constitutional duty,” Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferior officer for a

 

1988 Although the FBI director is an inferior officer, he is appointed by the President and removable
by him at will, see 28 U.S.C. § 532 note, and it is not clear that Congress could constitutionally provide the
FBI director with good-cause tenure protection. See OLC, Constitutionality of Legislation Extending the
Term of the FBI Director, 2011 WL 2566125, at *3 (O.L.C. June 20, 2011) (“tenure protection for an officer
with the FBI Director’s broad investigative, administrative, and policymaking responsibilities would raise
a serious constitutional question whether Congress had ‘impede[d] the President’s ability to perform his
constitutional duty’ to take care that the laws be faithfully executed”) (quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691).

corrupt reason—a reason grounded in achieving personal rather than official ends—does not
seriously hinder the President’s performance of his duties. The President retains broad latitude to
supervise investigations and remove officials, circumscribed in this context only by the
requirement that he not act for corrupt personal purposes.'”®

c. Congress Has Power to Protect Congressional, Grand Jury, and
Judicial Proceedings Against Corrupt Acts from Any Source

Where a law imposes a burden on the President’s performance of Article II functions,
separation-of-powers analysis considers whether the statutory measurc “is justified by an
overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.”
Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443. Here, Congress enacted the obstruction-of-
justice statutes to protect, among other things, the integrity of its own proceedings, grand jury
investigations, and federal criminal trials. Those objectives are within Congress’s authority and
serve strong governmental interests.

i. Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it
to all persons—including the President. Congress clearly has authority to protect its own
legislative functions against corrupt efforts designed to impede legitimate fact-gathering and
lawmaking efforts. See Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187, 206-207 (1957); Chapman
v. United States, 5 App. D.C. 122, 130 (1895). Congtess also has authority to establish a system
of federal courts, which includes the power to protect the judiciary against obstructive acts. See
U.S. CONST. ART. 1, § 8, cls. 9, 18 (“The Congress shall have Power . . . To constitute Tribunals
inferior to the supreme Court” and “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into Execution the foregoing powers”). The long lineage of the obstruction-of-justice
statutes, which can be traced to at least 1831, attests to the necessity for that protection. See An
Act Declaratory of the Law Concerning Contempts of Court, 4 Stat. 487-488 § 2 (1831) (making
it a crime if “any person or persons shall corruptly . . . endeavor to influence, intimidate, or impede
any juror, witness, or officer, in any court of the United States, in the discharge of his duty, or
shall, corruptly . . . obstruct, or impede, or endeavor to obstruct or impede, the due administration
of justice therein”).

ii. The Article 11 courts have an equally strong interest in being protected against
obstructive acts, whatever their source. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon,
a “primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch” is “to do justice in criminal prosecutions.”
418 U.S. at 707; accord Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 542
U.S. 367, 384 (2004). In Nixon, the Court rejected the President’s claim of absolute executive
privilege because “the allowance of the privilege to withhold evidence that is demonstrably

 

1989 The obstruction statutes do not disqualify the President from acting in a case simply because
he has a personal interest in it or because his own conduct may be at issue. As the Department of Justice
has made clear, a claim of a conflict of interest, standing alone, cannot deprive the President of the ability
to fulfill his constitutional function. See, e.g., OLC, dpplication of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential
Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 O.L.C. Op. at 356 (citing Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office
of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems
Arising out of the President’s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974)).

relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely
impair the basic function of the courts.” 407 U.S. at 712. As Nixon illustrates, the need to
safeguard judicial integrity is a compelling constitutional interest. See id. at 709 (noting that the
denial of full disclosure of the facts surrounding relevant presidential communications threatens
“[t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system”).

iii. Finally, the grand jury cannot achieve its constitutional purpose absent protection from
corrupt acts. Serious federal criminal charges generally reach the Article III courts based on an
indictment issued by a grand jury. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 327 (1940) (“The
Constitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process.”). And the grand jury’s
function is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment. U.S. CONST. AMEND. V. (“[n]o person shall be held
to answer” for a serious crime “unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury”). “[T]he
whole theory of [the grand jury’s] function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional
government, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the Government and the people,”
United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992), “pledged to indict no one because of prejudice
and to free no one because of special favor.” Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956).
If the grand jury were not protected against corrupt interference from all persons, its function as
an independent charging body would be thwarted. And an impartial grand jury investigation to
determine whether probable cause exists to indict is vital to the criminal justice process.

* #* *

The final step in the constitutional balancing process is to assess whether the separation-
of-powers doctrine permits Congress to take action within its constitutional authority
notwithstanding the potential impact on Article II functions. See Administrator of General
Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see also Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696; United States v. Nixon,
418 U.S. at 711-712. In the case of the obstruction-of-justice statutes, our assessment of the
weighing of interests leads us to conclude that Congress has the authority to impose the limited
restrictions contained in those statutes on the President’s official conduct to protect the integrity
of important functions of other branches of government.

A general ban on corrupt action does not unduly intrude on the President’s responsibility
to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. CONST. ARTII, §§ 3.'%° To the contrary,
the concept of “faithful execution” connotes the use of power in the interest of the public, not in
the office holder’s personal interests. See 1 Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English
Language 763 (1755) (“faithfully” def. 3: “[w]ith strict adherence to duty and allegiance™). And
immunizing the President from the generally applicable criminal prohibition against corrupt
obstruction of official proceedings would seriously impair Congress’s power to enact laws “to
promote objectives within [its] constitutional authority,” Administrator of General Services, 433
U.S. at 425—i.e., protecting the integrity of its own proceedings and the proceedings of Article IT1
courts and grand juries.

 

109 A5 noted above, the President’s selection and removal of principal executive officers may have
a unique constitutional status.

Accordingly, based on the analysis above, we were not persuaded by the argument that the
President has blanket constitutional immunity to engage in acts that would corruptly obstruct
justice through the exercise of otherwisc-valid Article 1T powers. '%!

3. Ascertaining Whether the President Violated the Obstruction Statutes Would
Not Chill his Performance of his Article IT Duties

Applying the obstruction statutes to the President’s official conduct would involve
determining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the act had a
nexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent. But applying those
standards to the President’s official conduct should not hinder his ability to perform his Article II
duties. Cf. Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 752-753 & n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on
the President in adopting a constitutional rule of presidential immunity from private civil damages
action based on official duties). Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect: the existence
of settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions, and the existence
of evidentiary limitations on probing the President’s motives. And historical experience confirms
that no impermissible chill should exist.

a. As an initial matter, the term “corruptly” sets a demanding standard. It requires a
concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an “improper advantage for [him]self
or someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.” BALLENTINE’S LAW
DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015);
Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That standard
parallels the President’s constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And
virtually everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear
governmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Accordingly, the President has
no reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually all instances, there will be no credible
basis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive.

That point is illustrated by examples of conduct that would and would not satisfy the
stringent corrupt-motive standard. Direct or indirect action by the President to end a criminal
investigation into his own or his family members’ conduct to protect against personal
embarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly motivated conduct.
So too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly and adversely affected the
President’s financial interests for the purpose of protecting those interests. In those examples,

 

1091 A possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not substitute for potential
criminal liability after a President leaves office. Impeachment would remove a President from office, but
would not address the underlying culpability of the conduct or serve the usual purposes of the criminal law.
Indeed, the Impeachment Judgment Clause recognizes that criminal law plays an independent role in
addressing an official’s conduct, distinct from the political remedy of impeachment. See U.S. CONST. ART.
I, § 3, cl. 7. Impeachment is also a drastic and rarely invoked remedy, and Congress is not restricted to
relying only on impeachment, rather than making criminal law applicable to a former President, as OLC
has recognized. A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C.
at 255 (“Recognizing an immunity from prosecution for a sitting President would not preclude such
prosecution once the President’s term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by resignation or
impeachment.”).

178


==================== PAGE 392 ====================

U.S. Department of Justice

Attorney—WorkProduet / May-Contain-Materiet-Proteeted-UnderFed—R—Crim—P-6(e}

official power is being used for the purpose of protecting the President’s personal interests. In
contrast, the President’s actions to serve political or policy interests would not qualify as corrupt.
The President’s role as head of the government necessarily requires him to take into account
political factors in making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings.
For instance, the President’s decision to curtail a law-enforcement investigation to avoid
international friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes. The criminal law
does not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy factors in the conduct of
government. And when legitimate interests animate the President’s conduct, those interests will
almost invariably be readily identifiable based on objective factors. Because the President’s
conduct in those instances will obviously fall outside the zone of obstruction law, no chilling
concern should arise.

b. There is also no reason to believe that investigations, let alone prosecutions, would
occur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to believe that
obstruction occurred. Prosecutorial action enjoys a presumption of regularity: absent “clear
evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official
duties.” Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272
U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926)). The presumption of prosecutorial regularity would provide even greater
protection to the President than exists in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any
matter involving the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough and
careful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice. Under OLC’s opinion that a
sitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment, only a successor Administration would
be able to prosecute a former President. But that consideration does not suggest that a President
would have any basis for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office. There
are “obvious political checks” against initiating a baseless investigation or prosecution of a former
President. See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 448 (considering political checks
in separation-of-powers analysis). And the Attorney General holds “the power to conduct the
criminal litigation of the United States Government,” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 694
(citing 28 U.S.C. § 516), which provides a strong institutional safeguard against politicized
investigations or prosecutions. '

 

1992 Similar institutional safeguards protect Department of Justice officers and line prosecutors
against unfounded investigations into prosecutorial acts. Prosecutors are generally barred from
participating in matters implicating their personal interests, see 28 C.F.R. § 45.2, and are instructed not to
be influenced by their “own professional or personal circumstances,” Justice Manual § 9-27.260, so
prosecutors would not frequently be in a position to take action that could be perceived as corrupt and
personally motivated. And if such cases arise, criminal investigation would be conducted by responsible
officials at the Department of Justice, who can be presumed to refrain from pursuing an investigation absent
a credible factual basis. Those facts distinguish the criminal context from the common-law rule of
prosecutorial immunity, which protects against the threat of suit by “a defendant [who] often will transform
his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions.” Imbler v.
Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 425 (1976). As the Supreme Court has noted, the existence of civil immunity
does not justify criminal immunity. See O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) (“Whatever may be
the case with respect to civil liability generally, . . . we have never held that the performance of the duties
of judicial, legislative, or executive officers, requires or contemplates the immunization of otherwise
criminal deprivation of constitutional rights.”) (citations omitted).

These considerations distinguish the Supreme Court’s holding in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that,
in part because inquiries into the President’s motives would be “highly intrusive,” the President is
absolutely immune from private civil damages actions based on his official conduct. 457 U.S. at
756-757. As Fiizgerald recognized, “there is a lesser public interest in actions for civil damages
than, for example, in criminal prosecutions.” Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754 n.37; see Cheney, 542
U.S. at 384. And private actions are not subject to the institutional protections of an action under
the supervision of the Attorney General and subject to a presumption of regularity. Armsirong,
517 U.S. at 464.

c. In the rare cases in which a substantial and credible basis justifies conducting an
investigation of the President, the process of examining his motivations to determine whether he
acted for a corrupt purpose need not have a chilling effect. Ascertaining the President’s
motivations would turn on any explanation he provided to justify his actions, the advice he
received, the circumstances surrounding the actions, and the regularity or irregularity of the
process he employed to make decisions. But grand juries and courts would not have automatic
access to confidential presidential communications on those matters; rather, they could be
presented in official proceedings only on a showing of sufficient need. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 712; In
re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 754, 756-757 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also Administrator of General
Services, 433 U.S. at 448-449 (former President can invoke presidential communications privilege,
although successor’s failure to support the claim “detracts from [its] weight”).

In any event, probing the President’s intent in a criminal matter is unquestionably
constitutional in at least one context: the offense of bribery turns on the corrupt intent to receive
a thing of value in return for being influenced in official action. 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(2). There can
be no serious argument against the President’s potential criminal liability for bribery offenses,
notwithstanding the need to ascertain his purpose and intent. See U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 3; ART.II,
§ 4; see also Application of 28 U.S.C. § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19
Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11 (“Application of § 201[to the President] raises no separation of powers
issue, let alone a serious one.”).

d. Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling effect justifies
exempting the President from the obstruction laws. As a historical matter, Presidents have very
seldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations. And it is rarer still for circumstances to
raise even the possibility of a corrupt personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the
President’s use of official power. Accordingly, the President’s conduct of office should not be
chilled based on hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt-motive standard
in this context.

In sum, contrary to the position taken by the President’s counsel, we concluded that, in
light of the Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues, we had a valid basis
for investigating the conduct at issue in this report. In our view, the application of the obstruction
statutes would not impermissibly burden the President’s performance of his Article II function to
supervise prosecutorial conduct or to remove inferior law-enforcement officers. And the
protection of the criminal justice system from corrupt acts by any person—including the
President—accords with the fundamental principle of our government that “[n]o [person] in this

country is so high that he is above the law.” United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 220 (1882); see

IV. CONCLUSION

Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw
ultimate conclusions about the President’s conduct. The evidence we obtained about the
President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were
making a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a
thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,
we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach
that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a
crime, it also does not exonerate him.

APPENDIX C
INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The President provided written responses through his personal counsel to questions
submitted to him by the Special Counsel’s Office. We first explain the process that led to the
submission of written questions and then attach the President’s responses.

Beginning in December 2017, this Office sought for more than a year to interview the
President on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice. We
advised counsel that the President was a “subject” of the investigation under the definition of the
Justice Manual—*“a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury’s investigation.”
Justice Manual § 9-11.151 (2018). We also advised counsel that “[a]n interview with the President
is vital to our investigation” and that this Office had “carefully considered the constitutional and
other arguments raised by . . . counsel, and they d[id] not provide us with reason to forgo seeking
an interview.”! We additionally stated that “it is in the interest of the Presidency and the public
for an interview to take place” and offered “numerous accommodations to aid the President’s
preparation and avoid surprise.”? After extensive discussions with the Department of Justice about
the Special Counsel’s objective of securing the President’s testimony, these accommodations
included the submissions of written questions to the President on certain Russia-related topics.’

We received the President’s written responses in late November 2018.* In December 2018,
we informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects.” We noted, among
other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he “does not ‘recall’ or
‘remember’ or have an ‘independent recollection’ of information called for by the questions.®
Other answers were “incomplete or imprecise.”” The written responses, we informed counsel,
“demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-
up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client’s recollection
or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection.”® We again requested an in-person
interview, limited to certain topics, advising the President’s counsel that “[t]his is the President’s

opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of
the evidence we have gathered.”” The President declined.'°

 

Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered
whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be inadequate.
But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial
evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation,
with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our
investigation and report. As explained in Volume II, Section IL.B., we determined that the
substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant
factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence
and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.

Response to Question I, Parts (a) through (c)

| have no recollection of learning at the time that Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, or Jared
Kushner was considering participating in a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially negative
information about Hillary Clinton. Nor do I recall learning during the campaign that the June 9,
2016 meeting had taken place, that the referenced emails existed, or that Donald J. Trump, Jr., had
other communications with Emin Agalarov or Robert Goldstone between June 3, 2016 and June
9,2016.

Response to Question I, Part (d)

I have no independent recollection of what portion of these four days in June of 2016 I spent in
Trump Tower. This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign, as the primary
season was ending and we were preparing for the general election campaign.

| am now aware that my Campaign’s calendar indicates that | was in New York City from June 6
~9, 2016. Calendars kept in my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various calls and meetings
scheduled for each of these days. While those calls and meetings may or may not actually have
taken place, they do indicate that | was in Trump Tower during a portion of each of these working
days, and I have no reason to doubt that [ was. When I was in New York City, I stayed at my
Trump Tower apartment.

My Trump Organization desk calendar also reflects that I was outside Trump Tower during
portions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower
in the early evening for Westchester where | gave remarks after winning the California, New
Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day. The June 8,
2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in late afternoon to attend a ceremony at my son’s
school. The June 9, 2016 calendar indicates | was scheduled to attend midday meetings and a
fundraising luncheon at the Four Seasons Hotel. At this point, I do not remember on what dates
these events occurred, but I do not currently have a reason to doubt that they took place as
scheduled on my calendar.

Widely available media reports, including television footage, also shed light on my activities
during these days. For example, | am aware that my June 7, 2016 victory remarks at the Trump

National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, New York, were recorded and published by the media. |
remember winning those primaries and generally recall delivering remarks that evening.

At this point in time, I do not remember whether 1 spoke or met with Donald Trump, Jr., Paul
Manafort, or Jared Kushner on June 9, 2016. My desk calendar indicates | was scheduled to meet
with Paul Manafort on the morning of June 9, but I do not recall if that meeting took place. It was
more than two years ago, at a time when | had many calls and interactions daily. '

Response to Question I, Part (e)

I have no independent recollection of any communications | had with the Agalarov family or
anyone | understood to be a representative of the Agalarov family after June 3, 2016 and before
the end of the campaign. While preparing to respond to these questions, | have become aware of
written communications with the Agalarovs during the campaign that were sent, received, and
largely authored by my staff and which I understand have already been produced to you.

In general, the documents include congratulatory letters on my campaign victories, emails about a
painting Emin and Aras Agalarov arranged to have delivered to Trump Tower as a birthday
present, and emails regarding delivery of a book written by Aras Agalarov. The documents retlect
that the deliveries were screened by the Secret Service.

Response to Question I, Part (f)

I do not recall being aware during the campaign of communications between Donald Trump, Jr.,
Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner and any member or representative of the Agalarov family, Robert
Goldstone, Natalia Veselnitskaya (whose name | was not tamiliar with), or anyone I understood
to be a Russian official.

Response to Question I, Part (g)

In remarks I delivered the night [ won the California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and
South Dakota Republican primaries, I said, “I am going to give a major speech on probably
Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with
the Clintons.” In general, | expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative
information about the Clintons, including, for example, Mrs. Clinton’s failed policies, the
Clintons’ use of the State Department to further their interests and the interests of the Clinton
Foundation, Mrs. Clinton’s improper use of a private server for State Department business, the
destruction of 33,000 emails on that server, and Mrs. Clinton’s temperamental unsuitability for the
office of President.

In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, | have become aware that the Campaign
documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution, and sources of information for
the speech I expected to give “probably” on the Monday following my June 7, 2016 comments.
These documents generally show that the text of the speech was initially drafted by Campaign staff

with input from various outside advisors and was based on publicly available material, including,
in particular, information from the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.

The Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack took place in the early morning hours of Sunday, June 12,
2016. In light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed more specifically to national security and
terrorism than to the Clintons. That speech was delivered at the Saint Anselm College Institute of
Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following:

This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President,
especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be. Even her
former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress,
has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president. There will
be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and | will
deliver that speech soon. But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing
threat of terrorism inside of our borders.

[ continued to speak about Mrs. Clinton’s failings throughout the campaign, using the information
prepared for inclusion in the speech to which I referred on June 7, 2016.

Response to Question I, Part (h)

[ have no recollection of being told during the campaign that Vladimir Putin or the Russian
government “supported” my candidacy or “opposed” the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. However,
I was aware of some reports indicating that President Putin had made complimentary statements
about me.

Response to Question I, Part (i)

I have no recollection of being told during the campaign that any foreign government or foreign
leader had provided, wished to provide, or offered to provide tangible support to my campaign.

APPENDIX D
SPECIAL COUNSEL’S OFFICE TRANSFERRED, REFERRED, AND COMPLETED CASES

This appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the Special Counsel’s Office, as
well as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed.

A. Transfers

The Special Counsel’s Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain
matters assigned to the Office by the Acting Attorney General have not fully concluded as of the
date of this report. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office
has transferred responsibility for those matters to other components of the Department of Justice
and the FBI. Those transfers include:

1. United States v. Bijan Rafiekian and Kamil Ekim Alptekin

U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia
(Awaiting trial)

The Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other
things, possible criminal conduct by Michael Flynn in acting as an unregistered agent for the
Government of Turkey. See August 2, 2017 Memorandum from Rod J. Rosenstein to Robert S.
Mueller, I1I. The Acting Attorney General later confirmed the Special Counsel’s authority to
investigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they “may have been jointly involved” with Flynn in
FARA-related crimes. See October 20, 2017 Memorandum from Associate Deputy Attorney
General Scott Schools to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.

On December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to an Information charging him with making
false statements to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
As part of that plea, Flynn agreed to a Statement of the Offense in which he acknowledged that
the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) documents he filed on March 7, 2017 “contained
materially false statements and omissions.” Flynn’s plea occurred before the Special Counsel had
made a final decision on whether to charge Rafiekian or Alptekin. On March 27, 2018, after
consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Special Counsel’s Office referred
the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin to the National Security Division (NSD) for any action
it deemed appropriate. The Special Counsel’s Office determined the referral was appropriate
because the investigation of Flynn had been completed, and that investigation had provided the
rationale for the Office’s investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin. At NSD’s request, the Eastern
District of Virginia continued the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.

Columbia handled the prosecution of Patten.

(Investigation ongoing)

The Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other
things, crime or crimes arising out of payments Paul Manafort received from the Ukrainian
government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych. See August 2, 2017
